That is a very good point about cyber-security.  

A good understanding of that would also be valuable if the student
wanted to get into cyber risk.  As Ronnie notes, a deep understanding of
networking would be needed for this and that knowledge is very widely
applicable. 

Cyber risk is also starting to be a big topic for the re-insurers.

Breaches like the ones at Target and Sony are generating bit losses for
those companies.  

The simple fact is that probably every single fortune 500 company is
vulnerable to cyber attacks.  If you are following industry standards,
you are vulnerable.

My guess is there have been a lot more breaches than we are hearing
about.

There is, however, a lot of really excellent work going on to plug the
holes in the internet.  However, I would expect it to take several years
for protocols to be fixed and new ones widely adopted.  

Much of the good work revolves around distributed systems.  The current
internet relies on centralised services that everyone has to hope remain
un-hacked.  

Things might move more quickly if lack of security starts to hit
company's bottom line.

The situation is a complete mess.  For example, see this story:

DNS is horribly insecure and a widely used (by governments as well as
the bad guys) to deliver malware.  

Sony were thinking about using the DMCA (and other computer related
acts) to remove the addresses of pirate sites from DNS servers.

The key for someone starting out on their career is probably not to
focus too narrowly.
