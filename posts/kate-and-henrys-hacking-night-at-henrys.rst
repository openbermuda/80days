What
====

If you are interested in computing, hardware, software, art, music,
culture then come along.

Free and open software.

Open science.

Weather.

Culture.

When
====

Tuesday's from beer O'clock.

First event: Tuesday 20th October 2015.

I will be there from 6pm Bermuda time.

Where
=====

Henry VII's pub and restaurant in Southampton Bermuda.

If there are four or less will probably just grab a table in the bar.

If there are more I've been offered the room in the back of the sushi
restaurant.

Why
===

Let other's know what you are up to, share ideas, code, music, art.

Have fun.

Who
===

Anybody and everyone.

Whether you are Henry, Henri, Enrique,
Kate, Kathryn or Katrina.

Henry:

   Has gone back to Wales, but we can always work on a Henry
   simulator, plus there are pleny of Henry pictures on the walls.
   Might not be a wise idea.

Kate:

   Things didn't work out too well for Henry's Kates.

   There might be hacking, but the only thing being executed will be
   code. 

Agenda
======

If there are volunteers to present ideas, let me know and I will
advertise more widely.

Visitors
========

If you are visiting the island do come along.

If you want to know how to get to Henry's, number 7 bus will get you
there.

From town any number 7, just tell the driver you are going to Henry's
or Gibb's Hill Lighthouse.

If you want to climb the lighthouse, note that it closes at 4pm, but
it is always a good place to watch the sunset from.
