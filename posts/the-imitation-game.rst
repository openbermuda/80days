The `koding.com`_ global hackathon has been taking a bit of my time
the last few days.  

It seems I have been accepted for this and now just have to get a team
together, hopefully with others from Bermuda.

Meanwhile, Nick Hoskins posted a link to an intriguing puzzle, the
`Imitation Game`_

Very personal:

* cryptography
* computing and artificial intelligence
* puzzles
* mum
* mental illness
