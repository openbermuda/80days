For the 80 days project I decided to use the `django-allauth`_ package
to handle authentication.   

When I say I decided, the decision was actually made by the django
project `cookiecutter`_ I used to create the project.

This should provide lots of goodness in that it will allow users to
register and log in to the site using social media OpenID
authentication.  At least, I think that what it does.
