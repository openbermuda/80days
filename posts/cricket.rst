Last Saturday there was a big cricket match at Lord's.

Not the Lord's where England were falling apart as the Aussies were
dominating the second test, but Lord's in St David's, Bermuda.

Bailley's Bay were playing Cleveland County in what is known as the
Eastern Counties.

Each team in Bermuda has its colours, Bay are red and white, Cleveland
are blue and white.

I come from Sheffield, UK, a city divided between the blue and white
of the Owls and the Red and White of the Mighty Blades.  I follow the
Blades, so it was natural for me to be cheering for Bailley's Bay.

We had a slow start to the day and it was a long (for Bermuda) ride on
the moped to St David's, so we didn't get to the ground until just
before lunch.

The game was nicely poised, with Cleveland batting first and on about
80 runs for 4 wickets at lunch.

After lunch the Bay bowlers dominated and Cleveland were bowled out
for 126 in 45 overs.

Lord's is a wonderful ground, right by the ocean, with natural banks
on which people build stands.
