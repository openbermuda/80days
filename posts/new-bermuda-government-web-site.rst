In last week's thrown speech the government announced that a new
government web site will be created in 2016.

Why is a new website needed?
----------------------------

The existing government websites are built on top of proprietary
technologies such as Adobe Flash.

It would seem the government does not own the code to its own
websites.

Contracts were put out to tender, the winning bid invariably ends up
owning the code.  This locks the government into expensive support
contracts from the same contractors.

Systems become unsupportable if built on top of proprietary technology
that itself reaches end of life or if the contractor that owns the
code goes out of business.

Free Software and Open Data
---------------------------

Free software is software that gives its users the freedom to examine,
modify, change and re-distribute the software.

There are now millions of free software projects and the vast majority
of successful technology companies are building their products with
free software.

It is widely accepted in technology circles that the free and open
development methodology results in higher quality software, lower
total cost of ownership and more control for users.

Open data is a related concept.  Data is made freely available and
searchable by all.

Other jurisdictions have embraced open data, appointed open data
advocates.

They have run open data book clubs and hackathons to inform their
citizens of the data that is available and invite development of
innovative new tools. 

Will the government consider free and open source solutions?
------------------------------------------------------------

Many jurisdictions now mandate that solutions be build with free and
open software.

Others insist that free and open source solutions are given fair
consideration in the bidding process.

Will the Bermuda government be looking at free software solutions?

Will the government insist it has control of the code for its own website?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Will the government ensure it has control over the code running on its
own websites?

Will the government empower the community to contribute?
--------------------------------------------------------

There is a growing community of free software enthusiasts in Bermuda.

Will the government support that community by involving it in the
design and development of the new website?

Will it involve schools and the Bermuda college in the design and
development of its websites?

Will it empower its people to contribute to their own systems?

Will it open up the process to wide discussion and provide funds to
sponsor the best ideas?

Will the government support open data initiatives?
--------------------------------------------------

Other jurisdictions have demonstrated the value of making citizen's
data freely available and usable by the community.

Will the government embrace *open by default*.  Data will be open
unless there is a compelling reason to keep it secret.

Noting that securing data on today's computers is extremely difficult,
will the government take steps to reduce to a minimum the amount of
sensitive data it stores?

Will the government involve the community in privacy and open data discussions?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Privacy and information security affect everyone living on the
island.  Will the government invite contributions from the community
and an informed discussion about what data should be stored on
computers and who should have access to that data?
