            <div>
<p>Many years ago I was working a simple app to run on a Nokia Series 60
phone.</p>
<p>It was actually before phone apps were really a thing, or even called
apps.  Nokia had ported python to the Series 60 phones and had some
simple libraries you could use to build your Nokia apps.</p>
<p>I created one called <a class="reference external" href="http://anorak.sourceforge.net/">anorak</a>.  Around the same time Guido Van Rossum
posted some code to a thing he called <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/~guido/mclock2.py">mclock2</a>.  Growing up his
family had a clock which had three coloured discs and a bright light
behind them.  The disks rotate through the day giving pretty patterns
on the clock.  The clock was designed by Rob Juda.</p>
<p>Here is a screenshot from Guido's code.</p>
<img alt="../galleries/Fishnet/guido.png" src="../galleries/Fishnet/guido.png"><p>Guido created a Tkinter application to simulate the clock.  I liked
the clock, so ported it to Series 60 and used it as the default screen
for <em>anorak</em> which was a sort of poorman's GPS using cell tower
locations to figure out where I was.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to today and there is the Raspberry Pi and the Sense Hat.</p>
<p>The latter is on the International Space Station.  It plugs into the
pins on a pi and has:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Gyroscope</li>
<li>Accelerometer</li>
<li>Magnetometer</li>
<li>Temperature</li>
<li>Humidity</li>
<li>Barometric pressure</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition it has an 8x8 coloured LED array.</p>
<p>I am working on hooking all this up to my moped and wanted to learn
about to use the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/RPi-Distro/python-sense-hat">sense hat python interface</a>.</p>
<p>The interface is simple to use, just import the library and create a
SenseHat object and then you can talk to the device.</p>
<p>I could not find a drawing library to draw directly onto the 8*8 pixel
grid.  Instead I used PIL and ImageDraw.Draw.</p>
<p>This allowed me to create a 64x64 image with PIL, with very few
changes to the code.  I just needed the ImageDraw.Draw().pieslice
method.</p>
<p>Now to get down to 8*8 I just divided the image into an 8*8 grid with
8*8 pixels in each grid point.</p>
<p>I then just take the average pixel value and use hat.set_pixel() to
set that value.</p>
<p>The hands of the clock did not work too well.  In the end I made the
hour hand all black with a 10 pixel wide line.  The minute hand I did
in white, again 10 pixels wide.</p>
<p>Here is a photo of the end result.</p>
<img alt="../galleries/Fishnet/sense_hat_mclock.jpg" src="../galleries/Fishnet/sense_hat_mclock.jpg"><p>So, not quite as neat as the Tkinter version, but I have found I can
actually figure out the time from this thing.</p>
<p><em>UPDATE:</em></p>
<p>I thought I might be able to do add new method to create pixels.  I am
creating a 64 * 64 image using the Python Imaging Library tools.</p>
<p>This one uses a weighted average based on Euclidean distance from the
center of the 8 * * area being averaged.  The resulting clock is
looking prettier now.</p>
<p>Currently the hands are being drawn as 12 pixels wide lines, with a
black hour hand and a red minute hand.</p>
<p>Depending on what is going on with the coloured disks the time is
usually quite easily readable.  Sometimes you have to wait a few
seconds if there is a lot of red or dark colour on the clock, before
you can find the hands.</p>
<p>It is a fun little clock when you only need approximate time.</p>
<div class="section" id="sensors">
<h2>Sensors</h2>
<p>I have been playing with these a little.  I have a simple monitor
function that can be used to send data from the sensors to the pixel
display.</p>
<p>The temperature sensor is a little too close to the pi's processor, so
it is affected by the heat from the processor.  <a class="reference external" href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=104&amp;t=111457">This topic</a> on the
raspberry pi forum had some helpful suggestions.</p>
<p>There are two temperature sensors on the board. One with the humidity
sensor and one with the pressure sensor.  They are different distances
from the pi processor.</p>
<p>The incantation below can be used to get the CPU temperature.:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
vcgencmd measure_temp
</pre>
<p>With these three numbers it should be possible to find a reasonable
formula to get a good approximation of the real temperature.  To do
this I will just have to collect some data to fit a model to.</p>

<div class="section" id="joy-stick">
<h2>Joy Stick</h2>
<p>I am yet to experiment with this.  I suspect it will be fairly easy to
set something up so I can use it to switch between different displays.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="storing-readings">
<h2>Storing Readings</h2>
<p>This is also on the list.  Once I have this working I'll be able to
collect data as I am driving around Bermuda.  This will include data
from the accelerometer and the compass.</p>

<p>There is a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/index.php">raspberry pi forum index</a> which has some forums for a
wide range of subjects, including the AstroPy, the other name for the
Sense Hat.</p>
