So careful observers will note the project is running a little late.

The aim was to launce the site on February 1st.  I am not quite ready
to go live yet.   I want a few more features implemented first.  

I am also aware that there is a lot still to do.  But it was always
the plan to build features through the 80 day running of the
competition.

The good news is that after all the research and experimenting I have
found a lot of the gotchas.  In short, I have the tools and have
figured enough about how they work that I should be quite productive
from here on in.

Was cookiecutter a good idea?  Introduced me to lots of stuff.

Write it yourself v use someone elses code?   Maybe start with simple
own code, intend to replace.
