My primary email account is with Gmail.  Overall it works pretty
well.  In particular, it works well on the phone.

However, I have been finding email less and less effective as a
communication medium of late, for a number of reasons.

* There is too much clutter there.  

  Not really spam, but over the years too many organisations have got
  my email address.  Sometimes this is good: booking flights or hotels
  or whatever, the emails they send are useful, but then they send a
  bundle of spam and special offers.

* Some key contacts don't really use email.  Not naming names, but
  the younger you are the less likely it is that email will be your
  default way to communicate electronically.

* The Gmail interface in chrome is a resource hog.  Further it does
  not make good use of the real estate.

* The editor for writing emails is ok, but rather limited

* Some simple things are hard/impossible to do.  For example,
  sometimes I am working on a draft and want to share the draft with
  someone else, leaving the draft in the drafts folder.  No can do.

* I started using the amazing `vimium`_ plugin in Chrome.  For Gmail
  to work you have to switch off Vimium, but then you are left with
  tabs where the Vimium shortcuts don't work.  So, I think it is best
  to read email elsewhere.  I tried a browser window just for email,
  but I end up opening new tabs, so that quickly fails.  

Many years back I used to use RMAIL in emacs.  It was a powerful
client and I am left with my favourite editor.

So, asking google for *emacs email client* the answer that comes back
is gnus.

The `quickstart`_ on EmacsWiki was enough to get me as far as seeing
my gmail in emacs.  I even managed to read a few emails and may have
replied to one or two.

I have dabbled in gnus before, but it seems to have taken on a whole
new life since then.  I suspect a large part of the rest of this week,
or maybe this month is going to go on figuring out how it all works.

So far though, I am liking it, so it is a good start.
