<p>Hurricane Joaquim is now category 4 and expected to strengthen some
more.</p>
<p>It has been over the Bahamas for a long time now.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://bermudaweather.wordpress.com/">Michael Johnston</a>'s weather blog is a wonderful, Bermuda centric
weather blog and a good resource to check for those in Bermuda
wondering if Joaquin is heading this way.</p>
<p>Michael is currently studying meteorology at Penn State.  He worked at
the Bermuda weather service this summer.</p>
<div class="section" id="uncertainty-in-paths">
<h2>Uncertainty in paths</h2>
<p>There has been consdierable disagreement across models over what track
this storm will take.</p>
<p>The weather systems are complex at present.  The models are coming
into better agreement.</p>
<p>In situations like this it would be very useful to have more
information on the likely intensity given each path.</p>
<p>The National Hurricane Centre discussion is always helpful.  It feels
like the forecasts are getting better at getting the intensity right,
given the right track.</p>
<p>The track tends to be driven by larger systems whose interaction is
hard to predict.  But often, given the direction the hurricane travels
we can learn a bit about how those systems will evolve.</p>
<p>I believe that open and free software combined, with open scientific
collaboration, can help communities better prepare for these events.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="direction-of-change-in-model-predictions">
<h2>Direction of change in model predictions</h2>
<p>The way the model predictions move can be informative.</p>
<p>One of the models may have been leaning more in that direction, all of
them would likely have assigned some probability to the general
direcion.</p>
<p>There seems to be some inertia in the models, so sometimes as they
shift the direction of the forecast, the next update also moves a
little in that direction: when the forecasts are changing, more change
is often more likely, it indicates that the driving features are
changing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="climate-change">
<h2>Climate Change</h2>
<p>Sometimes it indicates there is a new factor in play.</p>
<p>Climate change is increasing occurrences of unusual weather.  Regions
are experiencing conditions at the extremes of what they have
experienced.</p>
<p>In many cases these are conditions that the region is poorly adapted
to.</p>
<p>The models will also be experiencing conditions outside the area where
they have been callibrated.</p>
<p>This will provide good data and new insigts to improve them for the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bermuda">
<h2>Bermuda</h2>
<p>The first anniversary of these storms is fast approaching.</p>
<p>For now Joaquin is moving very slowly, battering Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>The latest forecasts have it well west of Bermuda.</p>
<p>The track should become more certain over then next 24 hours or so.</p>
<p>Latest 11,00pm EDT October 1, 2015 discussion has this paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
The forecast models continue to indicate a track farther away
from the United States east coast and the threat of direct impacts
from Joaquin in the Carolinas and mid-Atlantic states appears to be
decreasing.  However, the threat of impacts in Bermuda has increased
and a Tropical Storm or Hurricane Watch could be required for that
island on Friday.</blockquote>
<p>It would be good to have more info on the likely intensity should it
take a path close to Bermuda.</p>
<p>There still appears to be a fair bit of uncertainty about the path.</p>
