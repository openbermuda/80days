.. description: The raspberry pi as a supercomputer
.. type: text

The raspberry pi 2 comes with around 6 times the processing power of
the original pi.

It is still fairly low powered, but it is interesting to compare the
pi with some older computers that were considered powerful in their
day.

The pi comes with an ARM 7, quad-core processor.  It also has a
Broadcom graphics processor that can potentially be used for compute
intensive work.

It also comes with 1GB of memory.

For disk storage the nornal approach is to use a micro SD card.  There
are 16GB cards that give 45MB/s read/write capability.

For less than $1000 you can get 20 pi's, with fast SD cards.  The
result is a machine with 80 cores, 16GB of memory and 320GB of disk,
with a combined bandwidth of 900MB/s read and write.

These things are low power, so a 20 pi machine would require just 100
watts of power.

It is reasonable to assume that more powerful devices will be
available in he future.

In short, computing power is becoming very, very cheap.

Renewable energy
================

One criticism often directed at renewable energy is that sun, wind and
wave are not reliable.  In order to reliably meet peak demand much
it is necessary to have much more capacity than is needed on average.

One way to mitigate this cost is to have uses for the spare capacity.

One possible use is to have a compute farm to mop up spare capacity.
This works particularly well if you have long running computations
that can be used to mop up spare compute cycles.

Bitcoin mining is one potential application.
