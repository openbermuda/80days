Since this blog is the nearest thing I have of a record of what I am
doing, well I guess `github`_ might have parts of the story, but in
general, if I want to recall what I did, here is where I come.

..  So, today was an adventure.  So lots of tutorials are videos
..  nowadays.  Lots of them.  Some are good

I started with a minor adventure of *node.js* land, including package
managers (npm) and packages such as `grunt`_.  At one point I had my
django site being served via grunt, which I undestand is another layer
of the onion.  Thinking this might be useful soon as I will be writing
code.  Live updates could be handy.

After this I still had to find some javascript with a pattern I could
follow.  By now I am getting a bit of a grasp on the parts.  It feels
like a really complicated way to render forms on a browser.  But as
that is something I've always found more painful that it should be, a
bit more pain to find a better solution might be worth the trouble.

So `Angular seed` came to the rescue.  I think in fact this is what
Nick was using a few weeks back at the global hackathon.  

So after a bit more fun of installing *npm* a few different ways and
something called *bower* which seems to be package manager for
`angular.js`_.  

But the best bit is that all this stuff actually did work.  And I
moved the app into my tree of code and that works under *npm* there
too.  So, I think I am 80% of the way to finishing my kindling.
