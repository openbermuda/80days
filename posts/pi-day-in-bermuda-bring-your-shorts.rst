March 14th, or 3.14, is the first 3 digits of pi.

The next few digits are 15926535...

So around 2pm and 2am, all the digits align.  There are some ideas to
do some fun things with raspberry pi's (and hopefully pies too).

Not sure of the details just yet, but will post more later.

I am in touch with others from PyCaribbean and will see if they have
anything planned.
