Hurricane Joaquim is now category 4 and expected to strengthen some
more.

It has been over the Bahamas for a long time now.
   

Uncertainty in paths   
--------------------

There has been consdierable disagreement across models over what track
this storm will take.

The weather systems are complex at present.  The models are coming
into better agreement.

In situations like this it would be very useful to have more
information on the likely intensity given each path.

The National Hurricane Centre discussion is always helpful.  It feels
like the forecasts are getting better at getting the intensity right,
given the right track.

The track tends to be driven by larger systems whose interaction is
hard to predict.  But often, given the direction the hurricane travels
we can learn a bit about how those systems will evolve.

I believe that open and free software combined, with open scientific
collaboration, can help communities better prepare for these events.

Direction of change in model predictions
----------------------------------------

The way the model predictions move can be informative.

One of the models may have been leaning more in that direction, all of
them would likely have assigned some probability to the general
direcion.

There seems to be some inertia in the models, so sometimes as they
shift the direction of the forecast, the next update also moves a
little in that direction: when the forecasts are changing, more change
is often more likely, it indicates that the driving features are
changing.

Climate Change
--------------

Sometimes it indicates there is a new factor in play.

Climate change is increasing occurrences of unusual weather.  Regions
are experiencing conditions at the extremes of what they have
experienced.

In many cases these are conditions that the region is poorly adapted
to. 

The models will also be experiencing conditions outside the area where
they have been callibrated.

This will provide good data and new insigts to improve them for the future.

Model statistics in forecasts

Graphics and satellite data

Bermuda
-------

The first anniversary of these storms is fast approaching.

For now Joaquin is moving very slowly, battering Caribbean islands.

The latest forecasts have it well west of Bermuda.

The track should become more certain over then next 24 hours or so.
