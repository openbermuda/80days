.. description: Another wonderful PyCon
.. type: text

I am writing this as I fly back to Bermuda from another wonderful
PyCon.  This year it was again in Montreal, the same venue as last
year.  The next two years it will be in Portland, Oregon.

This is just one of the wonders of PyCon, the opportunity to visit
vibrant cities with large tech communities.

The conference was bigger than ever, 3000 attendees.  My first PyCon
was a mere 400 or so attendees.  Happily, as the conference has grown
in size, it has retained the spirit that makes it a fantastic
experience for old and new pythonistas.  If anything, it is more
welcoming and inclusive as the years pass.  The community actively
seeks to be inclusive and there were a number of talks and events
along this theme.

The community spirit is absolutely fundamental to the success of
python.  It is one of the main reasons to consider the language.  When
you are working with python there is a huge community of enthusiastic
and dedicated people who are only too happy to share their work and
help others.

Below are some of the personal highlights from the conference, but
there really is so much going on that what you will read here is just
a snapshot of a very busy time.   

Satellite data for everyone
---------------------------

Chris Waigl gave an excellent talk on satellite imagery, the freely
available data, how to work with it and the python tools that enable
that work.

Seeing what others are able to do with data like this inevitably
inspires new ideas.  

I am planning to take a look at what imagery is available for Bermuda
over the period of the hurricanes Fay and Gonzalo that hit the island
separated only by six days.

There will definitely be good before and after imagery, with luck
there will also be some usable images from the six day period between
the storms.


The usual suspects
------------------

The python community has some very entertaining speakers that are
always worth looking out for.   

This year, for me, it was the three B's: Beazely, Bernhart and
Batchelder.

David Beazely is always entertaining.  This year he spoke on python
concurrency with live coding.  I am guessing there were close to 1000
people present.  For added kicks and giggles he chose python 3.5.0a3
(I think).  The key bit was the 'a', he was doing a live demo with an
alpha version of python: what could possibly go wrong?

Ned Batchelder spoke on python names and values, a wonderfully clear
exposition on how python stores values.  I recommend this talk to
anyone new to python, it will likely save you a few hours of chasing
mysterious bugs.

Gary Bernhardt followed up his *Rise and fall of javascript* from last
year with a closing keynote discussing


Not all Python
--------------

PyCon is by no means all python.  

There were talks on *Advanced Git*, ethics, inclusivity, freedom, the
brokenness of TLS (https).

Not all talks
-------------

The Expo Hall where conference sponsors had their booths also served
as the breakfast and lunch place.  As per last year, I found the Expo
Hall a valuable place to spend time.

The vast majority of sponsors booths are run by techies, not
marketting droids and they are great place to find others with similar
interests.

Meal times give an opportunity to sit at a random table and meet
others and share ideas.

MAGIC
-----

I have been interested in the MAGIC center at Rochester Institute of
Technology since hearing Remy DeCausemaker speak about it last year.

MAGIC allows students to take a minor in Open Source.
