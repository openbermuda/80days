One thing I am starting to realise is that old stuff still works: irc,
rss, gnus blogs, blog aggregation.

Online communiciation tools have become fragmented due to everyone
wanting to own the user base.  This is all fragmenting conversations.
facebook, google, twitter, github, whatsapp (not available in my
country wtf is that about?).

Cloud based services are also a big part of the fragmentation problem.
They are attractive to use: you do not need to run a server, but you
do have to set up an account, so we are back to identity ownership.

But what about when the hurricanes come?  If we are using cloud
infrastructure then we will likely lose it when it might really be
needed. 

The future is distributed.

Ethereum.
