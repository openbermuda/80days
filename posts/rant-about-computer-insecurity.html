<p>It seems that the more important something is to computer security the
more byzantine and patchy the documentation will be at explaining how
to make sure your computers actually are secure.</p>
<p>The problem is security is difficult. You only have to mess up once
and all bets are off.</p>
<p>Invarialby, getting stuff up and running involves a lot of hacking
around.  Eventually, you get the thing working, but by then it is
probably too late, even if you go back and plug all the holes And that
assumes you can remember what you did along the way.</p>
<p>In the open source world products are generally configured in a
<em>secure</em> way out of the box.  You have to explicitly switch off things
that are there for your protection.</p>
<p>That is all well and good, but without excellent documentation
non-expert users (which in fact is every user a project will have: we
are all novices when we start using a new product) are going to have
problems getting the thing working.</p>
<p>The result is insecurity everywhere.  And that is before we get into
all the backdoors that various organisations have been more than happy
to leave in products for their own purposes.</p>
<p>I don't have a good solution to this problem, the subject is complex.
What is clear is that the current situation just is not working.</p>
<div class="section" id="following-industry-standards">
<h2>Following industry standards</h2>
<p>To all those company's who are <em>following industry standards</em> you are
a huge part of the problem.  Those industry standards are horribly
broken, possibly by design.</p>
<p>There is no substitute for hiring someone that actually understands
the subject and listening to their recommendations.  Blindly following
standards that were introduced 30 years ago and which nobody can
remember why they were introduced is lame.</p>
<p>It might get you off the hook with your boss: we are just doing what
everyone else does, nobody got fired for choosing IBM, etc, etc.  But
the fact is that your security is really dependent on the fact that
there are more attractive targets, such as companies that actually
call themselves <a class="reference external" href="http://www.target.com/">Target</a> ;)</p>
<img alt="http://dailyangst.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/birthmark.jpg" src="http://dailyangst.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/birthmark.jpg"><p>As an example, every place I have ever worked has a <em>you must change
your password every 90 days</em> rule.  Really?  This rule was introduced
based on the time it would take a good sized computer to crack a
password given the hashed value that gets stored in password
files... in the 1980's.</p>
<p>The idea being that if you change every 90 days it will be unlikely
the crackers will crack your password before you change it.</p>
<p>NEWSFLASH: to all CIO's out there, computers have got faster
since 1980.  If you really want to protect against crackers that have
your hashed passwords then you probably need all your employees to
change their passwords about every five minutes.</p>
<p>Perhaps the one good thing that will come out of all the high profile
breaches we are hearing about at the moment is that some of this
archaic nonesense will be replaced by measures that genuinely increase
security.</p>
<p>However, with the technologies that most companies are dependent on,
the difficulty (or indeed near impossibility) of introducing genuine
security without making it impossible for everyone to do their jobs, I
think we are in for many more breaches in the coming years.</p>
<p>Indeed, I would wager that there have been lots more very significant
security breaches, we just have not heard about them (yet).</p>
