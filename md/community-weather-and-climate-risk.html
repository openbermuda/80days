<h3>1 Description</h3>
<p>Community weather and climate:</p>
<h3>2 Abstract</h3>
<p>I'm working to develop python and free software community here in
Bermuda. The potential is huge, and it can have a really positive
impact here and beyond. But things take time.</p>
<p>There is a lot of expertise in hurricanes. We have had three here in
just over a year.</p>
<p>Every season brings new insights. The models are getting good, but
still need careful interpretation.</p>
<p>One notable feature this year was that there was significant
uncertainty in the paths that storms would take, but the models were
able to give good insight on the impact given a particular track.</p>
<p>Compute resources are cheap these days, even the power to run them can
be provided by solar, wind or wave.</p>
<p>By sharing data and simulating multiple models across locations we can
provide more information to help mitigate the impact of storms.</p>
<p>Further, we can provide risk analyses for the likely impact of current
and future human behaviour on our climate.</p>
<p>The talk will follow the structure of an adventure, from hills to
mountains.</p>
<p>Everest is a mountain of data, Lamlam is a land of philosophies and
ideas, algorithms, theories.</p>
<p>Everest has many other resources, powerful computing, wonderful
software, brilliant people sharing ideas.</p>
<p>Lamlam is where we learn to understand each other.  Ask questions
about how we want to use computers, networks and information.</p>
<p>How we can create wonderful systems with simple, cheap hardware.</p>
<p>And how Jupyter ties it all together to help us look after our world.</p>
<h3>3 Outline</h3>
<p>I will be looking for images to illustrate each point.  Let's say 30
images, 1 minute a piece.</p>
<h4>3.1 Introduction</h4>
<p>I have worked with risk managements systems over the last 18 years.
Through this time I have been working with open source software, using
great tools to build systems to assess risk.</p>
<p>Hurricanes have always been an interest.  Much of this time I have
been living in Bermuda, where I now live.  I have a keen interest in
weather and climate.</p>
<p>Climate change presents challenges to risk modelling and weather
forecasting.</p>
<p>There have been significant developments in computing, especially the
low cost and low power raspberry pi.</p>
<p>Software developments too.  Making things.</p>
<p>Data, data, everywhere.</p>
<p>I will begin with some observations from the last two Atlantic
hurricane seasons.</p>
<h4>3.2 Hurricanes</h4>
<h5>3.2.1 2014 and 2015 seasons</h5>
<h6>Erika and Fay</h6>
<p>Is there anyone attending that could talk about Erika?</p>
<h6>Gonzalo and Joaquin</h6>
<p>Are there others that have information about Joaquin?  Also the
flooding caused be systems active at the same time.</p>
<h6>Damage surveys</h6>
<h6>Precipitation</h6>
<h4>3.3 Climate Change</h4>
<h5>3.3.1 Ice Cap melting</h5>
<h5>3.3.2 Ocean</h5>
<h5>3.3.3 Rising sea levels</h5>
<h5>3.3.4 Extreme weather events</h5>
<p>Growing evidence that frequency of extreme events is increasing.</p>
<p>Data to support this?</p>
<h5>3.3.5 Changes in Precipitation</h5>
<h5>3.3.6 Drought</h5>
<h5>3.3.7 Crops</h5>
<h5>3.3.8 Extreme Heat</h5>
<p>and cold.</p>
<h5>3.3.9 Raspberry Pi</h5>
<h6>Pi Day</h6>
<h4>3.4 Personal weather stations</h4>
<p>Raspberry pi's provide a cheap way to create simple weather
stations. A simple station that measures air pressure, temperature and
humidity can be built for less than $50.</p>
<p>The power requirements are low, so stations can be powered by solar
trickle charging a small battery.</p>
<p>Anemometers and wind direction sensors are valuable additions to
have and can be built at reasonably low cost.</p>
<h5>3.4.1 Learning</h5>
<p>Building these stations is an excellent project for a school or
college.</p>
<p>Once built, these provide lots of opportunities for school projects
related to weather.</p>
<p>In particular, studying the data from the stations can provide
interesting insights.</p>
<p>For example, when I built a station myself, I learnt that the
atmosphere is tidal.</p>
<h5>3.4.2 Stations</h5>
<h4>3.5 Data</h4>
<p>Data, data, everywhere.</p>
<p>There are a growing group of weather enthusiasts that have their own
personal weather stations.</p>
<h5>3.5.1 Weather Underground</h5>
<h5>3.5.2 Sunshine</h5>
<h5>3.5.3 Open Data</h5>
<h5>3.5.4 Satellite Imagery</h5>
<h5>3.5.5 Radar</h5>
<p>One of the most used resources in Bermuda are the animated radar
images that the weather service provides.</p>
<p>This data could also be used to estimate rainfall.  With rainfall
readings from lots of weather stations it should be possible to
calibrate models and gain better insight into rainfall within storms.</p>
<h4>3.6 Projects of interest</h4>
<p>Oasis</p>
<p>Global Precipitation Mission</p>
<p>related projects?</p>
<p>windyty</p>
<h4>3.7 Tourism</h4>
<h4>3.8 Bermuda</h4>
<h5>3.8.1 Bermuda Weather</h5>
<h5>3.8.2 BIOS</h5>
<h5>3.8.3 Others</h5>
<p>BEST, greenrock, ...</p>
<h4>3.9 Caribbean</h4>
<h4>3.10 World</h4>
<h4>3.11 Lam-Lam to Everest</h4>
