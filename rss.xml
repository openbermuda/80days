One day she was
heading out into town on one of her missions.  I asked if she wanted
me to run her wherever she was going in the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to confess, I don't really enjoy driving around Ottawa.  In
winter, when it is -25C outside then the car is a nice option to
have.  But I know I will spend a chunk of time stuck in traffic.
Plus, Ottawa is a grid system, there are traffic lights every block.
But, if ace-girl is running late then again the car can be handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This day, she just responded, "Don't worry, I will just take the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.showbus.com/galcanada/octranspo.htm"&gt;Red and White Limo&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular readers of this blog (if there are any! -- note to self, look
into google analytics) will know that I have a bit of a thing about
red and white, entirely due to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield_United_F.C."&gt;Red and White Wizards&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my ears pricked up at the mention of red and white.  I was a little
concerned &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Acegirl"&gt;ace-girl&lt;/a&gt; seemed to be planning to take the limo to get where
she wanted.  Really, I would much rather run her there in the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She quickly put my out of my misery.  The buses in Ottawa are red and
white, so &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Acegirl"&gt;ace-girl&lt;/a&gt; just referred to them as the red and white limo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always liked the bus.  I grew up in Sheffield, UK at a time
when the bus service was quite excellent.  Being under 16 I could go
anywhere in town for just 2 new pence.  Adults had to pay the princely
sum of 10 new pence.  I would walk down to the bottom of our road and
a bus would always turn up within 10 minutes or so.  No need to check
the timetable: the buses were often 5 minutes or so off schedule, but
they were so regular that it didn't matter.  Sheffield buses were
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.bus-and-coach-photos.com/picture/number3844.asp"&gt;Brown and Cream Limos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not really my favourite colour scheme, red and white would have been
better, but then the blue and white half of the city might never have
taken a bus.  In any case, these things looked like giant ice-cream
sandwiches: a block of vanilla ice cream sandwiched between two
wafers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ride into town was always fun.  I would sit upstairs, preferably
at the front where you could see everything.  My journey was down
Abbeydale Road.  It felt like you could literally find anything you
wanted on Abbeydale Road.  Looking out of the bus I would always
notice new things.  There was the cycle shop that had a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny-farthing"&gt;penny
farthing&lt;/a&gt; mounted above the shop window.   A bit further down there
was Bardwell's electronics store.  This was like a little hardware
store only it sold electronic components:  resistors, capacitors and
these new fangled things called transistors.  Oh, and you could still
get valves there too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well move on 30 or so years and I am now in Bermuda with &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Acegirl"&gt;ace-girl&lt;/a&gt;.
Nowadays she takes the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.bermuda-online.org/bermudabus.jpg"&gt;Pink and Blue Limo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anyone who enjoys buses, the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.bermuda-online.org/bermudabus.jpg"&gt;Pink and Blue Limo&lt;/a&gt; has to be one
of the best bus experiences in the world.  First of all, the buses are
pink and blue.  Pink to match the sand on the beaches, blue to match
the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bus stops are marked by pink or blue poles.  Pink means the bus is
heading in to town, blue means it is heading away from town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am lucky, I live at the top of a hill between South Shore and Middle
Road.  I can walk down to South Shore and take the 7, or I can go to
Middle Road and take the 8.  There is a bus every half hour, happily
at my point in the island the buses are off cut by 15 minutes, the
result is average waiting time should be less than 10 minutes most of
the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have a moped.  This is a great way to get around the island,
but on occasion I head into town and end up having a couple of beers.
One such occasion was last Wednesday.  The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield_United_F.C."&gt;Red and White Wizards&lt;/a&gt;
were playing Tottenham Hotspur in the first leg of the League Cup
semi-final.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Blades are two divisions below Spurs.  Just getting to this semi
was quite an achievement.  I headed in to town with &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Acegirl"&gt;ace-girl&lt;/a&gt; to
watch the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can expect, for such a major fixture the bar was packed out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="../galleries/Blades/packed_out_at_the_hood.jpg" src="http://swfiua.github.io/80days/galleries/Blades/packed_out_at_the_hood.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 400px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was fearing the worst.  The Blades have actually been doing really
well in the cups since &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Clough"&gt;Nigel Clough&lt;/a&gt; took over as manager.  But
after years of following the Blades I know not to get my hopes up.  I
really just hoped that the game wouldn't be over in 20 minutes with us
3-0 down and the prospect of a pointless game at Bramall Lane the
following week.  In fact, first half the blades looked in control,
even had a couple of half chances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The longer the game went on, the more I dared to hope.  Spurs did get
a penalty, which they scored, but the game finished 1-0.  As this is
two legs, the blades are just 1-0 down at half-time with the second
leg due to be played in front of a sell-out crowd at the Lane.
Tomorrow could be fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, suffice to say, riding home on the bike was not an option.  We
left the bike with one of the people working in the bar.  His bike was
off the road due to a scary accident, happily he just had a bit of
road rash and some bruises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day I took the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.bermuda-online.org/bermudabus.jpg"&gt;Pink and Blue Limo&lt;/a&gt; in to town to collect
the bike.  I walked down to the 7, but was sat on the wall admiring
the view and looking for my ticket when the bus sailed past.  Not the
driver's fault, I wasn't at the actual stop.  Fortunately, I had time
to walk over the hill, getting there just in time to admire the view
before the 8 turned up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bermuda bus etiquette is quite complex.  The buses are smaller than
normal buses and only single decker, mainly because the roads here are
pretty narrow.  If you are on the bus you wait until it has come to a
stop before getting up from your seat to get off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The school children always give up their seat to older people.
Everyone greets the driver as they get on the bus.  Usually, there are
a bunch of regulars on the bus.  It is Bermuda, everyone knows
everyone and you see people catching up on news as they encounter
friends and relatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always like to get a seat by the window.  On the number 7 the views
of the South Shore beaches are breathtaking.  On the number 8 you are
inland for much of the journey, but it is never dull.  You
will get glimpses of the ocean, but also see lots of the wonderful
coloured houses and of course all the plants and trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the hurricanes Gonzalo and Fay, back in October there has been
lots more to look at.  First, there was all the damage to the trees as
well as some property damage.  Within a couple of days everything was
pretty much running as normal, but everywhere you looked there were
people helping clean up.  Either soldiers in the regiment, those
working for the government as well as many proud Bermudians working
together to get the island back on its feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the hurricanes took out a lot of trees, so now you can see things
you never knew were there.  The older Bermudians just smile, they have
seen it before, after Fabian or Emily or Felix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The journey is a good time to think, to slow down, experience
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVyE6hZjCU"&gt;another world that is Bermuda&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am writing this post today in part because the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.bermuda-online.org/bermudabus.jpg"&gt;Pink and Blue Limo&lt;/a&gt;
is off the road.  Unfortunately, the government here is short of
money.  As a result, they have been trying to reduce the wage bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is coming at a time when the island is full of excitement having
won the right to host the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.americascup.com/"&gt;America's Cup&lt;/a&gt; in 2017.  There is a lot of
work to do to get the island ready for this.  But the government is
broke.  And to deal with that they made an agreement with the unions
to cut wages in return for days of &lt;em&gt;furlough&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know the ins-and-outs of it all, but the hope was this would
be a temporary measure and that after a year or so the budget would
begin to balance and hours would be restored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This now doesn't look like happening and so the last two days there
have been peaceful demonstrations in town in protest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is hoping that all parties will get around the table and work out
a solution that works for all of Bermuda and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Acegirl"&gt;ace-girl&lt;/a&gt; can get back
to her &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.bermuda-online.org/bermudabus.jpg"&gt;Pink and Blue Limo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and if the blades could somehow pull off a miracle tomorrow, that
would also be good ;)&lt;/p&gt;

into my 80days repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's mission is to start turning that into the app I really want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first things I want to do is fix up angular so that it uses
different markers for its template substitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/"&gt;Django&lt;/a&gt; uses '{{' and '}}' to mark blocks that the template engine
needs to pay attention to and do substitutions.  Actually, the &lt;cite&gt;django
template languate&lt;/cite&gt; has two escape patterns:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{ and }} are used to mark variables to be expanded&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{% and %} are used to mark django template tags.  These get used for
things like marking &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; loops and the like&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now by an unhappy coincidence, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://angularjs.org/"&gt;angular.js&lt;/a&gt; also uses {{ and }} to
mark stuff for expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happily, angular allows you to over-ride these markers, as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code javascript literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;my_app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;angular&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'MyApp'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;$interpolateProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;$interpolateProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;startSymbol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'{$'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;$interpolateProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;endSymbol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'$}'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, since I already had some code in my &lt;em&gt;app.js&lt;/em&gt; I just added the
extra config code, so my &lt;em&gt;app.js&lt;/em&gt; now looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code javascript literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'use strict'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Declare app level module which depends on views, and components
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;angular&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'myApp'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'ngRoute'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'myApp.view1'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'myApp.view2'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'myApp.version'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;]).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'$routeProvider'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;$routeProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;$routeProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;otherwise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;redirectTo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'/view1'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}]).&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;$interpolateProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;$interpolateProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;startSymbol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'{$'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;$interpolateProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;endSymbol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'$}'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, making some progress, but I still can't figure out this controller
thing and how to tie it all together.  Time to go back to
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://campus.codeschool.com"&gt;codeschool&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, their &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://campus.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angular-js"&gt;shaping up with angular&lt;/a&gt; introduction.  I had
to register with codeschool.  Thankfully, that was painless bar having
to create yet-another-password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it has been worth it.  You can watch the videos at 1.5x or 2.0x or
slow them down.  It would be great if they took the mythtv trick and
shifted the frequency of voices down so that the presenters don't
sound like chipmunks on speed when you speed things up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good bit is you can click on "Start Challenges" as soon as you are
bored with the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once in the challenges, the "check my work" button is genius and
extraordinarily helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="angular-date-filter"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Angular date filter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just fell in love with the angular date filter.  Feed it a unix
datetime and it does the right thing.  Eg Unix time began 1969/12/31 @
8:00PM in Bermuda, note the four our offset from UTC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See this &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/swfiua/80days/commit/04a9b8a64f9cb402c434ad1f6b6224757ca09182"&gt;github commit&lt;/a&gt; for some code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="thanks"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thanks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to @ergoemacs on twitter who posted a link to their excellent
mini tutorial on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_magit-mode_tutorial.html"&gt;magit-mode&lt;/a&gt;: git mode for emacs.  I had this
installed already, but never quite plucked up the courage to try it.
Wow: git in emacs: lovely jubbly!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And thanks to stack exchange for this tip on how to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17798109/how-can-i-diff-a-single-file-with-magit"&gt;diff a single
file with magit&lt;/a&gt;,  Answer: just hit tab in the magit status buffer on
the line for the file you want to diff.  More &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=lovely+jubbly"&gt;lovely-jubbly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, thanks to Snowy, who helped with the coding:&lt;/p&gt;

top ten list of people I would like to meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been an free and open software enthusiast for longer than I care
to remember.  Let's just say that over the years Bill hasn't exactly
been a friend of open source.  To be fair, it pretty much threatened
to destroy his rather lucrative business model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To some extent it has.  Bill has moved on, so has Steve "linux is a
cancer" Balmer.  Microsoft is making more and more code available as
open source.  I would guess they have realised that if you want to be
relevant in today's software world you need your stuff to run on
linux, or at least play nicely with that platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot going on in the tech world, it isn't clear how it is
all going to pan out.  But free and open source is stronger than
ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night, my &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Acegirl"&gt;ace-girl&lt;/a&gt; and I wandered down the hill to the local
hostelry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://swfiua.github.io/80days/posts/the-music-from-uncle.html"&gt;blogged&lt;/a&gt; a few weeks back, Saturday there is a DJ at this place
and it is often a fun night.  We were planning to meet another friend
who had just got back to the island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrived and things were still quiet.  They were showing some
highlights from the FA Cup on the TV.  I love the FA Cup, always have
done.  It is when the lower league teams get a chance to show what
they can do against higher clubs.  Yesterday was a great day for the
underdogs.  Bradford City, also known as the &lt;em&gt;Bantams&lt;/em&gt; (curiously,
google in their soccer info used the name &lt;em&gt;Bantams&lt;/em&gt; rather than
Bradford City.  It was odd, because every other club was listed by
their more formal name.  It was Sheffield United, not the Blades
playing a Preston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were quite a few people having dinner at the place and 2-3 were
celebrating birthdays.  DJ Uncle was doing his round of the room,
figuring out his audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around this time a guy walked by wearing a t-shirt and a silver tie,
all sparkles and glitter, obviously top quality as it was ready-tied
and held around his neck by a piece of elastic.   I saw the words,
"Bill's Gates" on his t-shirt.   My curiousity was peaked and we got
talking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It soon became clear it was the guy's birthday.  He introduced himself
as Bill Gates (or it might have been Bill's Gates).  There may have
been some alcohol involved, so details are a little blurry.  But the
gist was he was founder member of "BFBC".  The F is along the same
lines as the f in swfiua.  So it was "Bill's F* Boat Club".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, this was my chance to be photographed with the man himself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="../galleries/Gates/Me%20with%20Bill's%20Gates.jpg" src="http://swfiua.github.io/80days/galleries/Gates/Me%20with%20Bill's%20Gates.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 400px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can report that Bill was a fine upstanding character and was even
kind enough to give me one of his t-shirts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="../galleries/Gates/i_got_the_t_shirt.jpg" src="http://swfiua.github.io/80days/galleries/Gates/i_got_the_t_shirt.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 400px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in case you haven't heard Bermuda has been chosen as the venue for
the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.americascup.com/en/news/131_Bermuda-is-the-home-of-the-2017-America-s-Cup.html"&gt;2017 America's Cup&lt;/a&gt;.  There is quite a bit of excitement about
the island due to this.  Maybe BFBC will enter the race :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Uncle played &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inS9gAgSENE"&gt;Happy Birthday&lt;/a&gt; for Bill and the others with
birthdays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been on a bit of a Springsteen kick that last week or so,
something to do with starting to learn some tunes from my "Bruce
Springsteen easy guitar":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="../galleries/Springsteen/Springsteen.jpg" src="http://swfiua.github.io/80days/galleries/Springsteen/Springsteen.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 400px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ace girl asked Uncle if he would play some.  And in light of the giant
killings in the FA Cup and with the hope of more to come from the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield_United_F.C."&gt;Red
and White Wizards&lt;/a&gt; it was appropriate that he should choose &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vQpW9XRiyM"&gt;Glory Days&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks Bill and everyone who helped make last night a fun time.&lt;/p&gt;

doing, well I guess &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/swfiua/"&gt;github&lt;/a&gt; might have parts of the story, but in
general, if I want to recall what I did, here is where I come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- So, today was an adventure.  So lots of tutorials are videos --&gt;
&lt;!-- nowadays.  Lots of them.  Some are good --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started with a minor adventure of &lt;em&gt;node.js&lt;/em&gt; land, including package
managers (npm) and packages such as &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://gruntjs.com/"&gt;grunt&lt;/a&gt;.  At one point I had my
django site being served via grunt, which I undestand is another layer
of the onion.  Thinking this might be useful soon as I will be writing
code.  Live updates could be handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this I still had to find some javascript with a pattern I could
follow.  By now I am getting a bit of a grasp on the parts.  It feels
like a really complicated way to render forms on a browser.  But as
that is something I've always found more painful that it should be, a
bit more pain to find a better solution might be worth the trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So &lt;cite&gt;Angular seed&lt;/cite&gt; came to the rescue.  I think in fact this is what
Nick was using a few weeks back at the global hackathon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after a bit more fun of installing &lt;em&gt;npm&lt;/em&gt; a few different ways and
something called &lt;em&gt;bower&lt;/em&gt; which seems to be package manager for
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://angularjs.org/"&gt;angular.js&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the best bit is that all this stuff actually did work.  And I
moved the app into my tree of code and that works under &lt;em&gt;npm&lt;/em&gt; there
too.  So, I think I am 80% of the way to finishing my kindling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- type: text --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://swfiua.github.io/80days/posts/adventures-in-angular-land.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2015 19:58:44 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Dancing in the dark</title><link>http://swfiua.github.io/80days/posts/dancing-in-the-dark.html</link><dc:creator>Johnny Gill</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So ten days to go until this project is supposed to be up and running.
Now, this is a software project, just something I have been doing
mostly for my own amusement, but it has a deadline and I am starting
to hear that whooshing sound that deadlines make as the come by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am 70 days in, so what do I have?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a simple &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete"&gt;CRUD&lt;/a&gt; api built in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/"&gt;django&lt;/a&gt;.  It comes with data
migrations and code generators that mean adding new models should
require very little coding.  I have the api documented using
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/marcgibbons/django-rest-swagger"&gt;django rest swagger&lt;/a&gt;.  And I can manipulate tables using the
standard django admin interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also taken a look at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/tomwalker/django_quiz/"&gt;django quiz&lt;/a&gt; and it looks like it will
do a good job for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, so far no proper front end.  As far as the front end is
concerned I am &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoPwqDW5750"&gt;Dancing in the Dark&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had two hurricanes here in Bermuda back in October.  It is winter
now.  Actually, a beautiful day today, 21C, sunny, few clouds and
beautiful blue oceans.  I just rode out of town on the bus.  Must be
one of the best bus rides in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, come evening, the sun disappears and a chill descends as the
dampness comes out of the walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of wood around the island, branches broken by the
storms, whole trees knocked over.  In many cases, all the branches
have been cut off trees and the stumps set back up, green shoots of
recovery are starting to sprout from these stumps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I have been gathering wood for fires most nights.  It
reminds me of happy days on scout camps way back when.  Summer camps
with the scouts were the best.  We would cook all week on an open
fire.  Between us, and guided by &lt;em&gt;Skip&lt;/em&gt;, we would figure out how to
light fires, how to get a good fire going and then let it die down a
little for cooking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing you learn right from the start is, &lt;em&gt;you can't start a fire
without a spark&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is where &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://nedbatchelder.com//blog/201501/kindling_projects_page.html"&gt;kindling&lt;/a&gt; comes in. As I trim the bigger branches
to get logs for the fires the smaller twigs drop to the floor.  Once I
have logs you can gather up a bundle of smaller twigs.  This is the
kindling.  This is what lights the fire.  The tiny pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, today I am setting out on a little kindling project.  I want to
add a little box to the &lt;em&gt;Around the world in 80 days&lt;/em&gt; site with
today's date and a couple of other labels showing 80 days from now and
80 days before today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I could do this very quickly with django templates given the code
I already have.  But, I want to try &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://angularjs.org/"&gt;angular.js&lt;/a&gt;.  That way I will
have a new tool I can play with.  If it isn't working for me, then
maybe it will end up like the bow-saw that I find less fun to use than
the small hand axe, still useful, but not the tool I like to use most
of the time.  Or maybe, it will turn out to be a new and better hand
axe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, time to light the blue touch paper and stand well back.&lt;/p&gt;

frozen wastes of Canada complete with arriving home with a stinking
cold I am now at the, &lt;em&gt;"this code won't write itself"&lt;/em&gt; part of the 80 days
project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is quite a bit to do, but I am still finding distractions to
spend time on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been using &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.django-rest-framework.org/"&gt;django rest framework&lt;/a&gt; to create a REST api for
the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating serializers, api classes and url specs for these frameworks
is largely a matter of generating standard boiler plate code.  This is
the sort of stuff I hate doing: tedious and error prone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I originally wrote my own noddy code generator to help with some of
this, but was less than satisfied with the result: it was fine for my
immediate needs, but as I add more models to the application I would
need to do more autogeneration.  I had the inescapable feeling that my
code generator was probably more trouble than it was worth.  At the
same time, writing code like this by hand is deeply unsatisfying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, just when it was looking like I would have to start learning
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://angularjs.org/"&gt;angular.js&lt;/a&gt; and build the front end, Ned Batchelder came to the
rescue on Twitter by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/swfiua/status/554742651082539010"&gt;posting&lt;/a&gt; a link to a new release of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://nedbatchelder.com/code/cog/"&gt;cog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ned described it as "a small tool that does a small job well".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, it does.  It lets you embed python code (disguised as
comments) within your code to do the code generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few features in &lt;em&gt;cog&lt;/em&gt; that appealed to me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the code generator can be run in a way that over-writes the input
file with the newly generated code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it calculates checksums for the generated code and embeds them in
the output.  This is useful as it allows it to spot if you have
edited the code since it was generated and hence refuse to
re-generate that code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you can re-run and it will update the existing code, assuming the
checksums have not changed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armed with cog, I came up with &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/swfiua/django_eighty_days/blob/master/django_eighty_days/codegen.py"&gt;codegen.py&lt;/a&gt; to generate the boring
bits of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/swfiua/django_eighty_days/blob/master/django_eighty_days/api.py"&gt;api.py&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;em&gt;urls.py&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;serializers.py&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am quite happy with the results.  Doug Hellmann had suggested maybe
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/"&gt;cookiecutter&lt;/a&gt; might be a better solution to this problem.  In my
case, I am using cookiecutter to get the base files for my django
application, but this code generation cannot take place until you add
some models, hence the need for cog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better still would be to combine the two and add codegen.py and
suitable urls.py, serializers.py and api.py to the cookiecutter
template.  I'll add that to the list of things to do, if only to delay
the learning of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://angularjs.org/"&gt;angular.js&lt;/a&gt; ;)&lt;/p&gt;

is another world&lt;/a&gt;.  It really is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tiny island of just 60,000 people, a place with a complex history.
There are a lot of wonderful people here.  There are also some cool
things starting to happen here such as &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://code441.com"&gt;code441&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://wearebermuda.com/"&gt;wearebermuda&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is Christmas time.  The last Saturday before Christmas and there
are parties everywhere.  Many of them are company parties.  You know
the thing, you sort of have to go along.  With luck you'll get to sit
with some of the people at work you actually like.  As the night goes
on, if you are lucky, you will find some like-minded people to spend
time with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, no office party for me.  So, we went to a local bar.  There
is a DJ every Saturday night at this place.  The dance floor is always
packed, for a simple reason: he knows his crowd.  And he always walks
around before he starts, plans his work and works his plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night there must have been 60 cars parked in the area.  The place
was packed.  Everyone was having a good time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now only in Bermuda could a DJ start the evening with &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDC7NeVfc30"&gt;My God is
Awesome&lt;/a&gt;, follow it up with &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4WB2zfmps"&gt;Silent Night&lt;/a&gt; and already have his
audience tapping their feet and getting into the mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd never heard &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDC7NeVfc30"&gt;My God is Awesome&lt;/a&gt; before.  Actually, I am sure I
must of heard it, just hadn't really listend.  And I only really
listened this time because it reminded me of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://awesome.naquadah.org/"&gt;Awesome window
manager&lt;/a&gt;  I've been using awesome the last few weeks and it has had a
huge impact on the way I use my computer.   And I am only scratching
the surface of what it can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this was followed up with &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlVxEAUqWU0"&gt;You can't hurry love&lt;/a&gt;, an old version
by the Supremes.  Another special song for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there was &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdB-8eLEW8g"&gt;One Love&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFMtBibwrgY"&gt;Electric Slide&lt;/a&gt;, complete with line
dancing.  Bermudian line dancing has to be seen to be appreciated.
Last night was typical.  A mixture of regulars to the place and those
just there for the party.  Everyone having a good time
together. There were a lot of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Sxv-sUYtM"&gt;Happy&lt;/a&gt; people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My music tastes are a bit weird.  I pretty much follow the crowd.  And
my guitar music.  I have been (very slowly) learning to play over the
past few years.  I have a few books with tabs, most of them have the
word &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt; in their titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would pick a song and try the patience of those around me by playing
it over and over again, badly.  I would look at the tabs of some and
think, no way I can play that.  But now I am starting to get a little
better and a little more adventurous.  I am noticing songs that have
been there for years ready for me to play.  Song of the moment is the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZo88P1Ie94"&gt;The Joker&lt;/a&gt;.  Like all good songs, there is lots of scope for
changing the lyrics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
I'm a picker,
I'm a grinder,
I'm a lover,
I'm a sinner,
I play my music in the sun
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grinder not grinner, in tribute to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTXjp2bf1vo"&gt;Sheffield Grinder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And seeing as I have a bit of a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://git-scm.com/"&gt;git&lt;/a&gt; obsession:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
I'm a puller,
I'm a merger,
I'm a midnight coder,
I get my checkouts from github.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks Uncle, old stuff still works.  Sometimes it works way better
than the new stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could just check the code out on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://swfiua.github.io/80days/posts/https//koding.com"&gt;koding.com&lt;/a&gt; and run the project
with django's build in server, but I feel I should run it under
&lt;em&gt;nginx&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could have chosen &lt;em&gt;apache&lt;/em&gt;, but I keep hearing people mention
&lt;em&gt;nginx&lt;/em&gt; so I want to see what it is all about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gooling &lt;em&gt;nginx django koding&lt;/em&gt; threw up a guide to deploying django
with &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://agiliq.com/blog/2013/08/minimal-nginx-and-gunicorn-configuration-for-djang/"&gt;nginx and gunicorn&lt;/a&gt;, so let's try that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So all went well until I got to the bit about running the application
with &lt;em&gt;gunicorn&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My project layout is a little different to the one in the guide.  In
particular, the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/"&gt;cookiecutter&lt;/a&gt; I used to create the project lays out
the &lt;em&gt;django config&lt;/em&gt; stuff a bit differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I did the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE="80days.config.production"
gunicorn 80days.wsgi:application
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This got me as far as being told:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
ValueError: Couldn't setup configuration '80days.config.production.Production':
Secret value 'SECRET_KEY' is not set
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to disappear down the SECRET_KEY rabbit hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a little googling tells me a little about the secret key, but no
advice on how to go about keeping it secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So looking at what the wonderful &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django"&gt;cookiecutter django&lt;/a&gt; created I see
the following incantation in &lt;em&gt;config/production.py&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code python literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;configurations&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;values&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c"&gt;# SECRET KEY&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;SECRET_KEY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;values&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SecretValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;# END SECRET KEY&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is this &lt;em&gt;configuration.values&lt;/em&gt; thing?   Turns out it is coming
from the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://django-configurations.readthedocs.org/"&gt;django configurations&lt;/a&gt; application that the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/"&gt;cookiecutter&lt;/a&gt;
was kind enough to include.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, so it helps you not have to do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code python literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, that has to be a good thing :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So reading the docs I come to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
django-configurations allows you to optionally reduce the amount
of validation and setup code in your settings.py by using Value
classes. They have the ability to handle values from the process
environment of your software (os.environ) and work well in
projects that follow the Twelve-Factor methodology.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will leave this &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://12factor.net/"&gt;twelve factor&lt;/a&gt; thing for another day, but a quick
glance suggests there are some good guidelines there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, digging into the docs for django configurations (which, by the way
are quite excellent).  I come to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://django-configurations.readthedocs.org/en/latest/values/"&gt;this little gem&lt;/a&gt;.  In short, this
magic &lt;em&gt;values.SecretValue()&lt;/em&gt; is there to discourage me from actually
putting my secret key in the config file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is good, because I am pretty sure I have committed this sin in
pretty much every django project I have done up to now.  Thank you
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/"&gt;cookiecutter&lt;/a&gt; :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, I feel this another case where good intentions are
likely to result in bad security, for more see my &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://swfiua.github.io/80days/posts/rant-about-computer-insecurity.html"&gt;rant about computer
(in)security&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a tight deadline, how many developers would just slap a value in
the config file &lt;em&gt;just to get things working&lt;/em&gt; and be done with it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="now-what-was-i-doing"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Now what was I doing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, back to getting my site up and running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So armed with this new information I am back to trying to run
gunicorn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of errors from the production config, so I comment out a couple
of sections.  At this point I am not planning on using Amazon's AWS,
so that can all be commented out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I am sure I will need this &lt;em&gt;sendgrid&lt;/em&gt; thing just yet, so that is
getting commented out too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly there (I think), but gunicorn is still failing due &lt;em&gt;s3boto.py&lt;/em&gt;
being unable to import &lt;em&gt;StringIO&lt;/em&gt;.  Now this looks like a python3
problem, since in python 3, StringIO got moved to io.StringIO :(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, so boto is an interface to AWS. I am not using that, so this one
is easy to fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, &lt;em&gt;gunicorn&lt;/em&gt; is running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chrome is doing something weird, it is switching to https and then
hanging with a mysterious &lt;em&gt;establishing secure connection&lt;/em&gt; message.
However, firefox and even chrome from another machine are just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that's all for today, will finish this off tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

more byzantine and patchy the documentation will be at explaining how
to make sure your computers actually are secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is security is difficult. You only have to mess up once
and all bets are off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invarialby, getting stuff up and running involves a lot of hacking
around.  Eventually, you get the thing working, but by then it is
probably too late, even if you go back and plug all the holes And that
assumes you can remember what you did along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the open source world products are generally configured in a
&lt;em&gt;secure&lt;/em&gt; way out of the box.  You have to explicitly switch off things
that are there for your protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is all well and good, but without excellent documentation
non-expert users (which in fact is every user a project will have: we
are all novices when we start using a new product) are going to have
problems getting the thing working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is insecurity everywhere.  And that is before we get into
all the backdoors that various organisations have been more than happy
to leave in products for their own purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't have a good solution to this problem, the subject is complex.
What is clear is that the current situation just is not working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="following-industry-standards"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Following industry standards&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To all those company's who are &lt;em&gt;following industry standards&lt;/em&gt; you are
a huge part of the problem.  Those industry standards are horribly
broken, possibly by design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no substitute for hiring someone that actually understands
the subject and listening to their recommendations.  Blindly following
standards that were introduced 30 years ago and which nobody can
remember why they were introduced is lame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might get you off the hook with your boss: we are just doing what
everyone else does, nobody got fired for choosing IBM, etc, etc.  But
the fact is that your security is really dependent on the fact that
there are more attractive targets, such as companies that actually
call themselves &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.target.com/"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="http://dailyangst.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/birthmark.jpg" src="http://dailyangst.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/birthmark.jpg"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, every place I have ever worked has a &lt;em&gt;you must change
your password every 90 days&lt;/em&gt; rule.  Really?  This rule was introduced
based on the time it would take a good sized computer to crack a
password given the hashed value that gets stored in password
files... in the 1980's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea being that if you change every 90 days it will be unlikely
the crackers will crack your password before you change it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEWSFLASH: to all CIO's out there, computers have got faster
since 1980.  If you really want to protect against crackers that have
your hashed passwords then you probably need all your employees to
change their passwords about every five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the one good thing that will come out of all the high profile
breaches we are hearing about at the moment is that some of this
archaic nonesense will be replaced by measures that genuinely increase
security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, with the technologies that most companies are dependent on,
the difficulty (or indeed near impossibility) of introducing genuine
security without making it impossible for everyone to do their jobs, I
think we are in for many more breaches in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, I would wager that there have been lots more very significant
security breaches, we just have not heard about them (yet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://swfiua.github.io/80days/posts/rant-about-computer-insecurity.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2014 18:03:17 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>SWFIUA explained</title><link>http://swfiua.github.io/80days/posts/swfiua-explained.html</link><dc:creator>Johnny Gill</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I grew up in Sheffield in the UK.  There are two football teams in
Sheffield:  Sheffield United and Sheffield United reserves.  They play
in red and white stripes and are known as the &lt;em&gt;Mighty Blades&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also another team that goes by the name of Sheffield
Wednesday, also known as &lt;em&gt;The Owls&lt;/em&gt;, or ironically as &lt;em&gt;The Massive&lt;/em&gt;,
the owls or the Pigs.  Curiously, the followers of &lt;em&gt;The Massive&lt;/em&gt; also
refer to followers of the Blades as &lt;em&gt;Pigs&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you grow up in Sheffield you end up following one of the sides.  My
parents grew up within walking distance to Bramall Lane.  They were
both Blades, as were my grand-parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most families have members in the other camp, so for instance my
sister married an Owl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now live in Bermuda and here the closest thing to the Blades/Owls
rivalry is the Somerset v St George Cup Match rivalry.  Most
Bermudians don't get to choose who they follow: it is pretty much
decided at birth.  There should probably be a box to tick on Bermudian
birth certificates to specify which side you are going to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both these rivalries are intense.  There is always lots of banter and
when the two teams meet if your side doesn't win then going in to work
the next day is going to involve some ribbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living away from Sheffield means when the Blades lose I at least don't
have to listen to the fowls.  In fact, on the rare occasions when I
meet a Wednesday fan here it is good to meet a fellow Sheffield
exile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now neither the Owls or the Blades have been all that good in my
lifetime.  Both have had spells in the top flight, both have had the
odd cup run here and there, but both have had more dreary 0-0 draws on
a cold damp February afternoon against some other struggling club such
as Grimbsby or Crewe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many afternoons at Beautiful DownTown Bramall Lane (BDTBL) there has
been nothing to cheer apart from maybe a stray dog wandering on to the
pitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the day there was no fancy digital scoreboard, just the
letters A-Z with hooks alongside with room for someone to go and hang
up the scores at half time.  If you wanted to know which game was
which you had to buy the program.  But A was always for the Owls game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is more, the Owls score would get updated every time a goal went
in.  When the Blades play at home, the Owls are away.  Since most
seasons they are likely to be struggling the odds are they will lose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when the man wanders out and puts up the score and the crowd sees
that they have let a goal in, the chant would go up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
Sheffield Wednesday Fucked It Up Again
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a good day, you would hear the chant 2-3 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is where swfiua comes from.   In short, the loudest cheer at
many a Blades game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is not all doom and gloom as a Blade.  Last night was yet
another memorable cup tie at BDTBL.  We were drawn at home to
Southampton in the quarter final of the League (Capital One) Cup,
also known as the "whatever it is called this year cup".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of the draw Southampton were defying gravity and placed
2nd in the Premier League.  Meanwhile the blades were holding their
own in League One, but not exactly scoring goals for fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meanwhile, the football gods have intervened, Southampton's
last few league games have been tough ones and they have lost them
all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All was set for a classic cup upset at BDTBL on a December night in
Sheffield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a good crowd.  Night games at BDTBL are always special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point it is worth saying a word about &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Clough"&gt;Sir Nigel Clough&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to talk about Nigel without mentioning his father,
although I hesitate to do this, it cannot be easy being Brian's son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian Clough was an absolute genius of a football manager.  He was
always entertaining in interviews, always had sides that played good
football and his teams always respected referees and won fairly.  Oh,
and Brian always took the cups seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nigel Clough has now been in charge for 18 cup ties, all whilst the
Blades have been down in the third tier of UK football.  They have
only lost 2 ties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night was a wonderful win.  They took the game to Southampton.
The longer it went on the more I started to believe they might
actually win.  As a Blade, this is an uncomfortable feeling.  So many
times, just when you think we are going to do something it all
unravels.  The journey is always fun though, but we all know how it
ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well last night was one of those rare occasions when everything went
well.  We got to half time 0-0.  We were the better side first half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first 10 minutes after half time were going to be key.
Southampton no doubt got a talking to, we had to be ready for them to
come at us.  Southamptin did come out a little stronger, but the
Blades held their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then the unbelievable happended, one of those freaky goals, ball
trickling over the line, with keeper and Sparky McNulty both racing to
get to it.  Sparky won the race and sparked off a fantastic last 30
minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know it will end in tears, but it is nights like this that make it
all worth while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said to a Chelsea fan (who also had a soft spot for Derby) before
the game, the great thing about following the Blades is if we win two
games on the trot it is like winning the Champion's League.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So on to the semis, looking forward to the draw later today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and those wondering how the Owls did this year in the League Cup:
they lost 7-0 to Man City in the third round.  &lt;strong&gt;swfiua&lt;/strong&gt; * 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>football sufc blades</category><guid>http://swfiua.github.io/80days/posts/swfiua-explained.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2014 15:13:30 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
