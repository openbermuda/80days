give Bermuda's public transport users up to date information on where
the buses and ferries actually are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transit authorities that have made this data available have found a
number of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.actsoft.com/public-transportation-profits-from-gps-tracking/"&gt;benefits&lt;/a&gt; of bus tracking, including increased usage of
public transport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a thriving open source project, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://onebusaway.org/"&gt;One Bus Away&lt;/a&gt; which looks
like it could be used in the Bermuda environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A first step in getting the transport data into the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference"&gt;General Transit
Feed Specification&lt;/a&gt; (GTFS) format.  This provides a flexible format
for transit data.  It is how you specify bus stop locations, routes
and timetables.  Once you have your data in this format there are a
number of projects that you can use to create a powerful transit
application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://onebusaway.org/"&gt;One Bus Away&lt;/a&gt; project is an open source project that is being
used in a number of US and Canadian cities.  It should be usable here
in Bermuda too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google provides good support for transit information and the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2015/06/the-netherlands-debuts-new-google-public-transport-service/"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; recently became the first country in the world to
provide full information via their service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst this support from Google is good to have, since many tourists
will be using google maps whilst visiting the island, there are
benefits to being in control of your own data and websites.  There are
restrictions on the use of Google maps and you are not in control of
future development when you use that platform.  Further, users may not
wish to share their location with Google due to privacy concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=bermuda#map=12/32.2949/-64.7830"&gt;OpenStreetMap&lt;/a&gt; is an free and open project to make top quality
digital maps available.  The Bermuda map is quite excellent.  Further,
there is a good open source javascript library, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://leafletjs.com/"&gt;leaflet&lt;/a&gt; to create
interactive maps using OpenStreetMap data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months back Open Bermuda started work on a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/openbermuda/wheres-de-bus"&gt;Where's de bus&lt;/a&gt;
project during a hackathon.  The challenge at that time was finding
out where the actual bus stops were.  It is hoped that it will be
possible to get this information and full bus and ferry timetables in
machine readable form from the Bermuda Transportation Board (BTB).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the small size of Bermuda and its transit network it would also
be possible to crowd-source the data for a transit application.  If
live GPS data is not avaialable from BTB an alternative would be to
create a mobile application that public transport users could run and
use to report bus locations as well as how full the bus currently is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are already some open source GPS tracking systems available such
as &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.opengts.org/"&gt;OpenGTS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.traccar.org/"&gt;Traccar&lt;/a&gt; that might be usable here.&lt;/p&gt;

point during your trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the biggest and busiest of the South Shore beaches.
Whenever there is a long weekend things will be happening on Horseshoe
Bay, such as the annual Good Friday flying of kites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Horseshoe Bay you can walk along the coast, past a number of
smaller and quieter beaches and coves.  Often you will be able to find
a beach to yourself, with pink sands, turquoise water and tropical
fish swimming around the reefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the top of the driveway that leads down to Horseshoe Bay you will
find Southampton Rangers football and cricket club.  On the weekend
you might be able to watch some cricket and get some refreshment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a restaurant, Gulf Stream where you can get a bite to
eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less than a couple of hundred yards to the west you will find a small
side-road, Turtle Place.  This is where local artist Sharon Wilson
lives.  Her home is also her studio and her gallery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If she is open for visitors she usually puts out a &lt;em&gt;sandwich board&lt;/em&gt; at
the end of the road, sometimes with a couple of balloons attached.  In
that case, you are in luck.  She will welcome you to her home and let
you discover her art.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>art</category><category>bermuda</category><guid>http://swfiua.github.io/80days/posts/sharon-wilson.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 24 May 2015 15:40:38 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>PyCon 2015</title><link>http://swfiua.github.io/80days/posts/pycon-2015.html</link><dc:creator>Johnny Gill</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am writing this as I fly back to Bermuda from another wonderful
PyCon.  This year it was again in Montreal, the same venue as last
year.  The next two years it will be in Portland, Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just one of the wonders of PyCon, the opportunity to visit
vibrant cities with large tech communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference was bigger than ever, 3000 attendees.  My first PyCon
was a mere 400 or so attendees.  Happily, as the conference has grown
in size, it has retained the spirit that makes it a fantastic
experience for old and new pythonistas.  If anything, it is more
welcoming and inclusive as the years pass.  The community actively
seeks to be inclusive and there were a number of talks and events
along this theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community spirit is absolutely fundamental to the success of
python.  It is one of the main reasons to consider the language.  When
you are working with python there is a huge community of enthusiastic
and dedicated people who are only too happy to share their work and
help others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are some of the personal highlights from the conference, but
there really is so much going on that what you will read here is just
a snapshot of the magic that is PyCon and the python community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also in no particular order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="satellite-data-for-everyone"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Satellite data for everyone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Waigl gave an excellent talk on satellite imagery, the freely
available data, how to work with it and the python tools that enable
that work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing what others are able to do with data like this inevitably
inspires new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am planning to take a look at what imagery is available for Bermuda
over the period of the hurricanes Fay and Gonzalo that hit the island
separated only by six days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will definitely be good before and after imagery, with luck
there will also be some usable images from the six day period between
the storms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-usual-suspects"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The usual suspects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The python community has some speakers that are very skilled at
presenting complex ideas in an entertaining and informative way.
They are always worth looking out for.  If you are new at PyCon, ask
others what talks they are going to, it will help you be in the right
room for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and don't panic, pretty much all talks are recorded and available
online (youtube seems to have replaced PyVideo here).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, for me, it was the three B's: Beazely, Bernhart and
Batchelder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="david-beazely-live-coding"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;David Beazely live coding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always enjoy listening to David Beazely.  This year he spoke on
python concurrency with live coding.  I am guessing there were at
least 1000 people present.  For added kicks and giggles he chose
python 3.5.0a3 (I think).  The key bit was the 'a', he was doing a
live demo with an alpha version of python: what could possibly go
wrong?  He demonstrated the way the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)
impacts performance of threaded code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One line that grabbed my attention was that the GIL does not behave
like an operating system.  The GIL is all about making sure threads
don't trample on each other by mangling shared data.  In short, within
python only one thread can run at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="ned-batchelder-names-and-values"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ned Batchelder names and values&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ned Batchelder spoke on python names and values, a wonderfully clear
exposition on how python stores values.  I recommend this talk to
anyone new to python, it will likely save you a few hours of chasing
mysterious bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="gary-bernhardt"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gary Bernhardt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gary Bernhardt followed up his &lt;em&gt;Rise and fall of javascript&lt;/em&gt; from last
year with a closing keynote motivated by Donald Rumsfeld's
&lt;em&gt;known-unknowns&lt;/em&gt; speech.  He talked about beliefs programmers have,
that really have an underlying belief driving them.  Discovering that
underlying belief is the key to being able to discuss these ideas with
others that have differing views.  He gave an example along these
lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
Python needs tests because it does not have static typing
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
I don't need tests because I have types
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gary pointed out that these two statements cannot both be true, unless
tests are somehow the same as types and eloquently exposed the
underlying beliefs behind these statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="not-all-python"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not all Python&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyCon is by no means all python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were talks on &lt;em&gt;Advanced Git&lt;/em&gt;, ethics, inclusivity, freedom, the
brokenness of TLS (https).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="not-all-talks"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not all talks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Expo Hall where conference sponsors had their booths also served
as the breakfast and lunch place.  As per last year, I found the Expo
Hall a valuable place to spend time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of sponsors booths are run by techies, not
marketting droids and they are great place to find others with similar
interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meal times give an opportunity to sit at a random table and meet
others and share ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="magic"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;MAGIC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been interested in the MAGIC center at Rochester Institute of
Technology since hearing Remy DeCausemaker speak about it last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MAGIC allows students to take a minor in Open Source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="lightning-talks"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lightning talks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lightning talks are always fun, often at the end of the day.  Speakers
have precisely 5 minutes to talk.  If you want to give a talk, just
sign up on the board.  These are usually over-subscribed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="poster-sessions"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Poster Sessions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday morning the expo hall switched into a combined jobs fair and
poster sessions.   The poster sessions were small booths where people
created posters relating to projects and ideas they are working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can then wander around and talk to people working on ideas you are
also interested in.  These complement the talks in that it gives a
chance for more detailed discussion with the people running the
projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="live-captioning"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Live captioning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the talks had live captioning.  This captioning was remarkably
good with essentially real time display.  It even coped well with
speakers that added a bit of French.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="keynotes"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Keynotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacob Kaplan-Moss's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIJdFxYlEKE"&gt;keynote&lt;/a&gt; reflected the focus on inclusivity in the
python community.  He talked about how programmers are all perceived
either to &lt;em&gt;rock&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;suck&lt;/em&gt;.  In short we are led to believe that the
distribution of programming abilities is essentially an upside down
bell-curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacob pointed out the absurdity of this perception and also its very
damaging consequences.  The reality is that programming ability, like
most attributes, should follow a normal distribution, hence the vast
majority of programmers are just average or as Jacob described
himself, &lt;em&gt;I am a mediocre programmer&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The python community is full of people who use python in order to get
other stuff done in a very wide range of activities.  It is widely
used in science, finance, education and a plethora of other areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, you will often hear pythonistas say, "I am not a real
programmer".   I would include myself in this bracket, despite having
spent my entire working career building software of one sort or
another.  But that software has always been a means to an end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe my reality is closer to being &lt;em&gt;good enough&lt;/em&gt; at quite a lot
of things and having the capacity to become &lt;em&gt;good enough&lt;/em&gt; at anything
I am passionate enough about to pursue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to get there you have to deal with the &lt;em&gt;little hater&lt;/em&gt;.  The voice
that eats away at you saying, "You suck at this".   Many software
communities will confirm this belief for you.  The python community is
trying to be different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By insisting that all programmers &lt;em&gt;rock&lt;/em&gt; we are excluding the vast
majority of programmers from that activity.  This causes angst for
those already pursuing at the activity and dramatically increases the
barrier to entry.  The result is a smaller, less diverse, less
interesting and less effective community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks Jacob for a truly inspiring talk.  Thanks also to the python
community for recognising and trying to address this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="sprinting"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sprinting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My flight home was not until Monday evening, so I was able to attend
the first day of code sprints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the conference closed on Sunday afternoon, sprint leaders were
given a couple of minutes to talk about what they would be working
on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was then an introductory session organised, primarily aimed at
people new to sprinting, but also of great benefit to more experienced
sprinters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were people giving introductions to git, virtualenv, virtualbox,
testing in python, http and more.  Each introduction was repeated 3
times in 15 minute sessions.  Hence, everyone could listed to three
subjects of there choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this a useful session to fill in some gaps in my knowledge and
also to get to know some of the other sprinters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pycon-videos"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PyCon videos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this blog post has sparked your interest in PyCon I would encourage
you to watch some videos from the talks.  Just go to youtube and
search for PyCon 2015.  See the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/"&gt;schedule&lt;/a&gt; if you want to see the
full list of talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-state-of-the-python"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The state of the python&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I like to attend PyCon is that you get a very good
feel for where the language and community is currently placed, what
projects are being widely used, what projects are up and coming and
generally where the community is heading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have watched PyCon grow and be delighted that it has not lost the
excitement and sheer inspiration it always generates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community is stronger than ever and making great efforts to be
more inclusive and accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="python-3-x"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Python 3.x&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guido in his keynote spoke again about the challenges of moving to
Python 3.  Whilst there are still large numbers of projects that have
not been ported (Guido quoted only 5,000 out of 55,000 on PyPi),
things are actually way better than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the top 1000 most used projects have been ported.  The reality
is that if you are starting a new project, python 3.x is a great
choice.  You will be using projects that are in active development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are maintaining a large body of python 2.x code then that is
where things become more challenging.  It only takes one critical
package that is not ported and you are stuck.  Indeed, this is why
the process of moving to python 3.x has taken so long, a project
cannot be ported until all its dependencies are also ported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My takeaway from this PyCon was that more than ever people are using
and enjoying python 3.x.  I think we are moving to a time when
new packages will be available under python 3.x and not under python
2.x and this will provide incentive to switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="micro-bit"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Micro Bit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK, in a project driven by the BBC is planning to give 1 million
school children a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/mediapacks/makeitdigital/micro-bit"&gt;Micro Bit&lt;/a&gt; computer.  These are small raspberry pi
like devices.  Python will be used as one of the languages to use on
the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More generally, python is widely used in education.  The Python
Software Foundation deserves a lot of credit for this, there has been
a huge amount of work over many years promoting the language in
education and it is reaping rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="summary"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another wonderful conference that has, as always, generated a lot of
exciting ideas for me to pursue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>python montreal</category><guid>http://swfiua.github.io/80days/posts/pycon-2015.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 14 Apr 2015 13:31:56 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Blades and Sens results correlated?</title><link>http://swfiua.github.io/80days/posts/blades-and-sens-results-correlated.html</link><dc:creator>Johnny Gill</dc:creator><description>&lt;div tabindex="-1" id="notebook" class="border-box-sizing"&gt;
    &lt;div class="container" id="notebook-container"&gt;

&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have felt for a while that when the Blades win, the Sens also seem
to do better.  When the Blades lose, the Sens don't do so well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My guess is this is mostly just perspective, but I follow both teams.
Blades, or Sheffield United, are hoping to get a place in the League 1
play-offs.  The Sens, or Ottawa Senators, are trying to get into the
Stanley Playoffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you'd asked me at the start of the year, I would have thought being
about where we are was a distinct possibility.  I still felt we might
push into the top two.  That would get us up to the Championship
automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sens on the other hand appeared to be going nowhere.  Until the
inevitable sacking of the coach to be replaced by Dave Cameron, who
was the assistant up to that point.  And for a while nothing changed,
but then a new goalie was brought in, due to injuries.  Since then
they have been on a run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last few games have been just like watching the Blades.  The
Blades never (well almost never) do it the easy way.  So it is always
a season of maybe, just waiting for the point where it all unravels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this Sens run has been different.  They are already way beyond
what anyone could have hoped for a few months back.  But now they are
tantalisingly close to a playoffs, with a team that is playing well
and having fun.  But like the Blades, they've been doing it the hard
way.  3-0 leads disappearing, coming from behind to go on and win in
over-time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Getting-some-data"&gt;Getting some data&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="http://swfiua.github.io/80days/posts/blades-and-sens-results-correlated.html#Getting-some-data"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, there has been a lot going on and my guess is that anything
that might be in the data will be better explained by major changes such
as of coaching staff or players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So first problem, getting the data.  I am planning to just get this season's results for both teams and extract the days when they both played, then take a look at how the results lined up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Yesterday's-games"&gt;Yesterday's games&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="http://swfiua.github.io/80days/posts/blades-and-sens-results-correlated.html#Yesterday's-games"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mighty Blades had a key game against local rivals Doncaster.  As
per usual, they did things the hard way, coming from behind twice to
end up winners 3-2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is two big wins over local rivals in a matter of days.  The
Blades are now firmly in the playoff positions, one more win from the
last three games might be all that is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another local side, Chesterfield, are looming large.  It feels like
they will play a part in the rest of our season.  I grew up on the
Chesterfield side of Sheffield, almost equidistant from the two
grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Senators were at home to the Pittsburgh Penguins last
night, in what really was a must win game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also fan appreciation night.  Within 10 seconds of the start
they were 1-0 down.  By 5 minutes in they were 2-0 down and by the end
of the first period it was 3-0.  Oh dear.  Sid Crosby on form and the
young Sens not firing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second period was a different story.  Sens put the Penguins under
pressure, but nothing finding the net, until 5 minutes from the end of
the period.  Pageau managed to sneak one in off one of the Penguin's
skates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;30 seconds into the third period they got a second.  Two minutes from
time they equalised and then Mark Stone fired in the winner in
overtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that is what I call a fan appreciation night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and Blades and Sens both win on the same night, so that hypothesis
is proven ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the second leg, but Bermuda, led by Nahki Wells, were already
5-0 win in the Bahamas last Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This game hadn't been generally broadcast in Bermuda.  But we had seen
highlights, and the first many of us knew about the game was via a
banner that was put out on the TV station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a long suffering supporter of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield_United_F.C."&gt;Mighty Blades&lt;/a&gt; I have rarely
been in the position of being able to go to a game, already 5-0 up.  I
have also never been to a World Cup game before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So today we set off early to the game on the moped.  The game was a
sell out, parking was likely to be tricky.  In any case, the build up
to the game would likely be fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was cold.  Not Canada cold, but Bermuda cold.  Cloudy and damp,
windy and looked like it could rain any minute.  The rain held off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The build up to the game was fun too.  Many in the crowd knew one or
more of the players well.  There was excitement that we would see a
few goals, and a slight fear that maybe things could unravel.  And
there were Gombeys :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bermuda did dominate the game from start to finish.  The goalkeeper,
Fredrick Hall, was substited at half-time.  I am guessing that he was
frozen, as the ball boys had all had a lot more work to do.  It was
a good time to give his back-up a chance to play, and he at least had
some saves to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nahki Wells won a penalty, then crashed the resulting kick against the
cross-bar.  This was close to half-time, Bermuda had already had 5-6
really good chances, but the ball didn't want to go in the net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier Wells had been fouled, about 30 yards out and needed treatment
from the physio.  He was then made to leave the field, and was not
able to be there for the free-kick that required the treatment.
Broken rules?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justi Donawa had what looked like a painful injury to his foot, and
had to be replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second half was more of the same, but Bermuda were increasingly
getting the feeling that it was going to end 0-0.  The players felt it
and the crowd too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Nahki Wells broke through and this time made no mistake, 1-0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this point every time Bermuda went forward, and that was
frequently, they looked like scoring.  The game ended 3-0.  The Gombey
Warriors will play Guatemala, away on the 8th of June, at home on the
16th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two last things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is a very young Bermuda team.  I heard the average age is
just 21.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Bahamas also have a young team.  They played a good game today,
the game flowed, there were lots of entertaining moments.  It can't
have been easy travelling away already 5-0 down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a great afternoon, two teams, refs and the crowd all played
their part.  Looking forward to the next games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;March 14th has become known as &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.piday.org/"&gt;Pi Day&lt;/a&gt;, on account of the fact that
the first three digits of the mathematical constant pi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year it is extra special, since the next two digits are 15, which
corresponds to the year.  After that, the next five digits of pi are
9:26:53.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To mark the occasion &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.chewstick.org/"&gt;Chewstick&lt;/a&gt; at the new premises on 81 Front St
is hosting a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/pi-day-is-around-the-corner/"&gt;Raspberry Pi Day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A raspberry pi is a $30 computer (Raspberry Pi) that runs off a phone
charger. We will be making videos of people performing, playing games
etc, so bring your camera, SD card, instruments to contribute your
content as we build a Raspberry Pi media centre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="../galleries/RaspberryPi/raspberry.jpg" src="http://swfiua.github.io/80days/galleries/RaspberryPi/raspberry.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will also have a retro games console running on a pi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan is to start the event at 9:26:53am and run with it until
9:26:53pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have three working raspberry pi's and some SD cards that can be used
to host the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have one pi running the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://kodi.tv/"&gt;Kodi&lt;/a&gt; media centre that I hope to add some
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.chewstick.org/"&gt;Chewstick&lt;/a&gt; and Bermuda content to.  The image below shows Kodi
displaying the Bermuda weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="../galleries/RaspberryPi/weather_pi.jpg" src="http://swfiua.github.io/80days/galleries/RaspberryPi/weather_pi.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have another pi running a retro games console and a third running
the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.raspbian.org/"&gt;Raspian&lt;/a&gt; operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no need to bring anything but yourself to the event, but if
you do have raspberry pi's or related hardware it would be good to
bring them along too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All going well, we will also have actual pies to eat too :)&lt;/p&gt;

Canada.  They were having difficulty understanding why I am thinking
it was so cold here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've lived in many places, but including hard Ottawa winters, but
never felt as cold as Bermuda the last few weeks.  It is all
perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had good times while they were here, below is just one of those
days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pink-and-blue-limo"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pink and blue limo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'd decided to go to Spittal Pond.  As we are down the west end of
the island, that means 2 buses, or &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://swfiua.github.io/80days/posts/the-pink-and-blue-limo.rst"&gt;the pink and blue limo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were in luck, the number 7 bus pulled up just as we reached the
stop.  A sunny day, so the views along South Shore were spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were soon in town and just had a bit of time between buses to look
at Victoria Park and the web of ropes holding up trees that have been
lifted back up since the hurricanes knocked them over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onto the number 1 bus and another beautiful journey.  You are higher
up on the bus, and see so a lot more.  Plus it stops every now and
again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="spittal-pond"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Spittal Pond&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="../galleries/SpittalPond/20150221_132114.jpg" src="http://swfiua.github.io/80days/galleries/SpittalPond/20150221_132114.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have liked Spittal Pond for a lot of years.  It is a place in
Bermuda where you can really feel in a natural environment.
Spectactular views and lots to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also a place that changes through the seasons, so there is
always something new to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the first time I had been since the hurricanes.  There wasn't
much sign of them on this walk.  Just a fiew views that didn't used to
exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we were treated to a sunny day without much wind.  The ocean
always looks better in the sun.  It lights up the clarity of the water
and the pink sand beneath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The path leads down to some rocks where in a few places there are
actually steps cut out to make it a little easier to clamber over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the waters edge there were a couple of large parrot fish, bobbing
around as the waves were breaking against the rocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="../galleries/SpittalPond/20150221_140921.jpg" src="http://swfiua.github.io/80days/galleries/SpittalPond/20150221_140921.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="portuguese-rock"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Portuguese Rock&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took the little detour up to a rocky cliff overlooking the ocean.
Here there is a brass plate that is a cast of an inscription that was
found on the rock here.  It has the date 1543 and some other marks
that have been interpretted as "R. P." standing for Rex Portugaline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1543 is nearly 70 years before the island was settled, indicating that
there is more to the early history of this island than we are every
likely to discover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="../galleries/SpittalPond/20150221_133042.jpg" src="http://swfiua.github.io/80days/galleries/SpittalPond/20150221_133042.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-farm-on-mcgalls-hill"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The farm on McGalls Hill&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once back at the road we decided to walk over the hill, past St Mark's
church and down McGall's Hill to the Northrock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part way down the hill we stopped to look at a small banana
plantation.  The farmer, Henry, and his wife, Theresa, were there
looking after the land and invited us down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henry delighted in telling us just what is invoved in growing
bananas.  He also showed us onions, giant cloves of garlic and new
potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They had such patience in showing how all the different plants
thrived.  Henry also told us about the fruit salad tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citrus fruit used to be a big thing in Bermuda.  If you visit the
island ask an older Bermudian about the citrus and they will tell you
Bermuda used to have some of the best citrus fruit you can find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henry explained that you can even grow fruit salad trees here: a
single tree that grows lemons, limes, oranges and grapefruit, all as a
result of grafting buts from different fruits onto a wild lemon base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, it was a great day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://swfiua.github.io/80days/posts/bermudaful-day.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Mar 2015 03:35:22 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Mercurial Adjustment</title><link>http://swfiua.github.io/80days/posts/mercurial-adjustment.html</link><dc:creator>Johnny Gill</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So careful observers will note the project is running a little late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim was to launch the site on February 1st.  I am not quite ready
to go live yet.   I want a few more features implemented first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also aware that there is a lot still to do.  But it was always
the plan to build features through the 80 day running of the
competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project has been a very interesting experience for me.  At the
start, I had a task that I knew I could get done in a few days.  With
stuff I had used in the past.  But, I wanted to learn some knew
stuff.  &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://angularjs.org/"&gt;angular.js&lt;/a&gt; was one thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like python and have enjoyed working with &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/"&gt;django&lt;/a&gt; over the
years.  It has been a struggle at times.  I've always loved what the
project is doing, it has been a constantly evolving project.  Often,
knew releases would break old sites.  This was actually a good thing,
a bit of reading and you could find the solution.  And if you
implemented it, your code was generally better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have loved &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/topics/migrations/"&gt;django migrations&lt;/a&gt;.  I like to develop sites as they
are being run.  Now one tricky bit is knowing when you can (or should)
let others loose on the site.  They might put work into it that would
be lost by changes you want to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where these migrations come in very handy.  Over the course of
what I have been doing I have been running:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
python 80days/manage.py makemigrations
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and/or:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
python 80days/manage.py migrate
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;more or less at random (as I got to know what the errors really mean,
so less random as time went on.  And what has been cool is that pretty
much every time they have lead me through the process and done exactly
what I wanted with pretty minimal fuss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Murphy's law dictates that I will now encounter a nightmare with
migrations, at some, inconvenient point.  The good news is I have good
confidence in these migrations.  In particular, I love the way you get
the code for the migration.  So, if I am doing something scary, or if
it all breaks, then I can take a look at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="angular"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Angular&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been a rocky ride at times.  On the face of it, it is doing
something elegant and simple.   But it is doing what it does inside
the DOM model as implemented by various browsers.  These browsers are
trying to be helpful.  So I spent an afternoon wrestling with &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/1459"&gt;angular
directives for table rows&lt;/a&gt;.  I just wanted to write a partial piece
of html for each row.  Now it seems this is really tricky to do in
angular because of the way browsers try to be helpful with broken
table code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I am happy with where things are.  There are a lot of areas
I would like to learn more about.  I need to spend an afternoon with
the node/angular testing setup.  I really do need to start writing
those tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, there are a lot of things I know can be done better, but
most are good enough for now and I can work on the pain points as they
become more aparent,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="summary"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that after all the research and experimenting I have
found a lot of the gotchas.  In short, I have the tools and have
figured enough about how they work that I should be quite productive
from here on in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was cookiecutter a good idea?  Very much so.  It introduced me to lots
of things that I would not of explored at this point otherwise.  Some
bits I have pretty much forgotten about, but I think most of the stuff
I have explored is mentioned in this blog somewhere, or in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/swfiua/"&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;.
So, if nothing else, it is there if I need to refer to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="and-finally"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;And finally..&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the mercurial adjustment works like this.  Every software project
runs late.  They run late for lots of reasons.  Most of them good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_%28planet%29"&gt;planet mercury&lt;/a&gt; orbits the sun in just under 88 days.  But
here on planet earth, in that time the earth moves, so that it is
actually nearly 116 days before the earth, mercury and sun are in a
similar alignment.  This probably needs to be done in a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jupyter"&gt;jupyter
notebook&lt;/a&gt;, so for now, the deal is that depending on your frame of
reference and definition of a day, 80 days could arguably be deemed to
be a shade over 105 days as most of us here on earth know them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So next time your n day software project is running late, come into
work dressed as Mercury ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enter, just give the nickname you want to use for the competion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next job is to add code to allow competitors to create and join teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shouldn't take too long given what I now have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>angular django python 80days</category><guid>http://swfiua.github.io/80days/posts/are-we-nearly-there-yet.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2015 15:43:05 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Angular velocity</title><link>http://swfiua.github.io/80days/posts/angular-velocity.html</link><dc:creator>Johnny Gill</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it has been a while since I blogged about the 80 day project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is largely due to most of my free time has been spent working on
the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to recap, 77 days into the project I still had quite a bit to
do.  Most of the work up to that point had been on getting pieces
together, decide what tools to use, learning those tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next job was to move the angular code around a bit and try and get
django serving it all.  In particular, I had decided it was probably
worthwhile to have the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://angularjs.org/"&gt;angular.js&lt;/a&gt; partial html pieces go through
the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/"&gt;django&lt;/a&gt; template engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting npm up and running, with a recent enough version can be
tricky, but there was an excellent guide on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions"&gt;Installing npm on Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With moving all the files around, &lt;strong&gt;.bowerrc&lt;/strong&gt; needed editing a few
times to point it at where the bower_components were now made to be
installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://swfiua.github.io/80days/posts/global-hackathon-team-bermuda.html"&gt;Global Hackathon, Team Bermuda&lt;/a&gt; I have had mild
paranoia that cross-site-request-forgery is going to bite me at some
point.  I am hoping that by serving everything under django I will
avoid that nightmare.  In the meanwhile, I did at this &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/swfiua/80days/commit/678ae25e432b8633230bf67f8168a8f8188717b1"&gt;csrf fix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A previous post, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://swfiua.github.io/80days/posts/nginx-on-kodingcom.html"&gt;Nginx on koding.com&lt;/a&gt; came in useful for setting
up postgres on koding.com as I decided it was more than time to get
this thing running on a cloud based machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not found myself using &lt;em&gt;django-angular&lt;/em&gt;, but the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://django-angular.readthedocs.org/en/latest/integration.html"&gt;django
angular integration&lt;/a&gt; docs have been an enormous help in highlighting
issues in integrating django and angular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In amongst all this I decided it was time to add &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/tomwalker/django_quiz/"&gt;django quiz&lt;/a&gt; to
the mix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was mostly painless, following the django-quiz docs, but when I
fired up the server it failed.  The problem was down to me using
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://django-allauth.readthedocs.org/"&gt;django-allauth&lt;/a&gt; which effectively removes &lt;em&gt;auth.User&lt;/em&gt;. The fix is to
use &lt;em&gt;settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL&lt;/em&gt; if you want to reference the &lt;em&gt;User&lt;/em&gt;
model in your own models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/tomwalker/django_quiz/commit/9416c05cd447e3aa40a2351684f2105dafa95e13"&gt;user model fix&lt;/a&gt; and made a pull request.  Happily, the
project maintainer actioned the request within the hour (many thanks
Tom!) and I was able to update to the new version with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By February 1st I was starting to get comfortable with angular and the
pieces were coming together.  I have some simple partials, I have
angular calling the django rest API and I have the beginnings of some
views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next task is to display competitions a user can enter and provide
an enter button.   At this point I did a bit more thinking and
reading.  Deciding what logic to put in angular and what to put in
django views and api calls needs a little thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here the plan is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get the competion list and competion entry features working&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get team creation and team membership features implemented&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get the site up and running in the cloud&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a simple test server on koding.com, but want to run the actual
site on a different instance.&lt;/p&gt;
