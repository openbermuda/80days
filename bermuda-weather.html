<p>Bermuda has just been through its third hurricane inside a year.</p>
<p>Fay, Gonzalo and Joaquin.  These three storms have all had signifcant
differences and all could have provided immense amounts of invaluable
data.</p>
<div class="section" id="hurricane-season">
<h2>2015 hurricane season</h2>
<p>Prior to Joaquin, the 2015 season had been quiet, although Erika did
cause flooding and deaths in Dominica.</p>
<div class="section" id="track-uncertainty">
<h3>Track uncertainty</h3>
<p>Uncertainty in track forecasts has been a feature of some of this
year's storms, with Joaquin being particularly difficult to forecast.</p>

<h2>Visitors and weather</h2>
<p>Short term forecasts are getting more reliable.</p>
<p>Back in the day, Bermuda used to provide a weather guarantee for
visitors, offering a 10% discount if certain targets were not met.</p>
<p>With modern weather forecasting we are sometimes able to have good
confidence up to 5 days out, with some skill as much as 10-12 days
out.</p>
<p>Bermuda weather is such that visitors are always in danger of heavy
rain during their visits.</p>
<p>Hotels could tailor their offerings to visitors booking at last minute
according to the weather forecast.</p>
<p>Such offers might be effective in boosting visitor numbers during
winter months, especially if combined with forecasts for the Eastern
US and Canada: if we know they are getting freezing conditions, snow
and ice whilst we will have excellent golfing weather it should be an
easy sell.</p>

<div class="section" id="gateways">
<h3>Gateways</h3>
<p>If we can work with those in gateway cities and beyond then we can get
better information on their weather too.</p>
<p>Many Bermudian residents travel widely, good forecasts for the places
they visit would be useful.</p>
<p>Weather informed house swap.</p>
<p>Airlines: weather informed scheuling.</p>
<p>Sustainable transport: geese and swans.</p>
<p>Renewable heaven.</p>

<div class="section" id="geek-tourism">
<h3>Geek tourism</h3>
<p>Free culture is starting to flourish here in Bermuda, it can be a
place that people will want to visit to spend time with those working
on projects here.</p>
<p>Weather and climate research is a global problem.  Bermuda has its own
identity but is culturally diverse, there are good connections with
many parts of the world.</p>
