government web site will be created in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="why-is-a-new-website-needed"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why is a new website needed?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The existing government websites are built on top of proprietary
technologies such as Adobe Flash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would seem the government does not own the code to its own
websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contracts were put out to tender, the winning bid invariably ends up
owning the code.  This locks the government into expensive support
contracts from the same contractors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Systems become unsupportable if built on top of proprietary technology
that itself reaches end of life or if the contractor that owns the
code goes out of business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="free-software-and-open-data"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Free Software and Open Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free software is software that gives its users the freedom to examine,
modify, change and re-distribute the software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are now millions of free software projects and the vast majority
of successful technology companies are building their products with
free software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is widely accepted in technology circles that the free and open
development methodology results in higher quality software, lower
total cost of ownership and more control for users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open data is a related concept.  Data is made freely available and
searchable by all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other jurisdictions have embraced open data, appointed open data
advocates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have run open data book clubs and hackathons to inform their
citizens of the data that is available and invite development of
innovative new tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="will-the-government-consider-free-and-open-source-solutions"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Will the government consider free and open source solutions?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many jurisdictions now mandate that solutions be built with free and
open software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others insist that free and open source solutions are given fair
consideration in the bidding process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will the Bermuda government be looking at free software solutions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="will-the-government-insist-it-has-control-of-the-code-for-its-own-website"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Will the government insist it has control of the code for its own website?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will the government ensure it has control over the code running on its
own websites?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="will-the-government-empower-the-community-to-contribute"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Will the government empower the community to contribute?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a growing community of free software enthusiasts in Bermuda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will the government support that community by involving it in the
design and development of the new website?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will it involve schools and the Bermuda college in the design and
development of its websites?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will it empower its people to contribute to their own systems?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will it open up the process to wide discussion and provide funds to
sponsor the best ideas?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="will-the-government-support-open-data-initiatives"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Will the government support open data initiatives?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other jurisdictions have demonstrated the value of making citizen's
data freely available and usable by the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will the government embrace &lt;em&gt;open by default&lt;/em&gt;.  Data will be open
unless there is a compelling reason to keep it secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noting that securing data on today's computers is extremely difficult,
will the government take steps to reduce to a minimum the amount of
sensitive data it stores?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="will-the-government-involve-the-community-in-privacy-and-open-data-discussions"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Will the government involve the community in privacy and open data discussions?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Privacy and information security affect everyone living on the
island.  Will the government invite contributions from the community
and an informed discussion about what data should be stored on
computers and who should have access to that data?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>bermuda</category><category>free software</category><category>open source</category><guid>http://openbermuda.github.io/80days/posts/new-bermuda-government-web-site.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 16 Nov 2015 16:55:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Where's de bus</title><link>http://openbermuda.github.io/80days/posts/wheres-de-bus.html</link><dc:creator>Johnny Gill</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year's TLF students are considering creating an application to
give Bermuda's public transport users up to date information on where
the buses and ferries actually are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transit authorities that have made this data available have found a
number of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.actsoft.com/public-transportation-profits-from-gps-tracking/"&gt;benefits&lt;/a&gt; of bus tracking, including increased usage of
public transport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a thriving open source project, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://onebusaway.org/"&gt;One Bus Away&lt;/a&gt; which looks
like it could be used in the Bermuda environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A first step in getting the transport data into the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference"&gt;General Transit
Feed Specification&lt;/a&gt; (GTFS) format.  This provides a flexible format
for transit data.  It is how you specify bus stop locations, routes
and timetables.  Once you have your data in this format there are a
number of projects that you can use to create a powerful transit
application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://onebusaway.org/"&gt;One Bus Away&lt;/a&gt; project is an open source project that is being
used in a number of US and Canadian cities.  It should be usable here
in Bermuda too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google provides good support for transit information and the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2015/06/the-netherlands-debuts-new-google-public-transport-service/"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; recently became the first country in the world to
provide full information via their service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst this support from Google is good to have, since many tourists
will be using google maps whilst visiting the island, there are
benefits to being in control of your own data and websites.  There are
restrictions on the use of Google maps and you are not in control of
future development when you use that platform.  Further, users may not
wish to share their location with Google due to privacy concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=bermuda#map=12/32.2949/-64.7830"&gt;OpenStreetMap&lt;/a&gt; is an free and open project to make top quality
digital maps available.  The Bermuda map is quite excellent.  Further,
there is a good open source javascript library, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://leafletjs.com/"&gt;leaflet&lt;/a&gt; to create
interactive maps using OpenStreetMap data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months back Open Bermuda started work on a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/openbermuda/wheres-de-bus"&gt;Where's de bus&lt;/a&gt;
project during a hackathon.  The challenge at that time was finding
out where the actual bus stops were.  It is hoped that it will be
possible to get this information and full bus and ferry timetables in
machine readable form from the Bermuda Transportation Board (BTB).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the small size of Bermuda and its transit network it would also
be possible to crowd-source the data for a transit application.  If
live GPS data is not avaialable from BTB an alternative would be to
create a mobile application that public transport users could run and
use to report bus locations as well as how full the bus currently is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are already some open source GPS tracking systems available such
as &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.opengts.org/"&gt;OpenGTS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.traccar.org/"&gt;Traccar&lt;/a&gt; that might be usable here.&lt;/p&gt;
