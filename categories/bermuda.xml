&lt;p&gt;So around 2pm and 2am, all the digits align.  There are some ideas to
do some fun things with raspberry pi's (and hopefully pies too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure of the details just yet, but will post more later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am in touch with others from PyCaribbean and will see if they have
anything planned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>bermuda</category><category>caribbean</category><category>pi</category><category>python</category><guid>http://openbermuda.github.io/80days/posts/pi-day-in-bermuda-bring-your-shorts.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 28 Feb 2016 00:41:06 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>PyCaribbean</title><link>http://openbermuda.github.io/80days/posts/pycaribbean.html</link><dc:creator>Johnny Gill</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am just relaxing after three fantastic days here in Santo Domingo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the first PyCaribbean conference: Python, palm trees, wonderful
people, a meeting of languages: Spanish, python, English, Restructured
Text, Markdown, with generous lashings of pandas, ipython and Jupyter
notebooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="santo-domingo"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Santo Domingo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santo Domingo is a bustling city of craziness, motorbikes carrying
three, cars going in all directions, horns and carnivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I speak little Spanish, but my wife is here to interpret, saving me
from my failed attempts to communicate.  One waiter looked
particularly perturbed.  Apparently, I had told him I love him in a
failed attempt to say how good the food was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People have been super friendly.  Mangling of their language is
treated with smiles and help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="python-in-santo-domingo"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Python in Santo Domingo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference organisers have done an amazing job building community
here in DR.   The vast majority of the 200 or so attendees were local
and actively using python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jorge Vargas talked about how he and others have worked to build up
community over the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the secrets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;organising monthly meetups, with schedule planned out 3 months
ahead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;co-ordinating with other tech groups: Ruby, Javascript, Linux,
Django Ladies and much more.   Having a shared calendar to avoid
collisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple organisers for each thread to help avoid burn out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-venue"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The venue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference was held in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.uasd.edu.do/index.php/biblioteca"&gt;Biblioteca Pedro Mir&lt;/a&gt; on the
University Autonoma de Santo Domingo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were staying at a hotel a 15 minute walk, mostly through the
campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="bermuda-shorts"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bermuda Shorts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Friday before the conference we walked over to the venue.  It
is hot and humid here, so shorts were the order of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we got to the centre the security wouldn't let us in.
Interpretter to the rescue: no shorts allowed, a policy for all
government buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt for the organisers, this is the sort of rule it is easy not to
think about, fortunately most attendees had at least one pair of
jeans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bermuda shorts had to wait for the evening dinner to make an
appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="opening-keynote-when-languages-collide"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Opening Keynote: when languages collide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brandon Rhodes, PyCon 20176 chair, gave the opening keynote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brandon is always an entertaining speaker and this was no exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was python's unofficial 25th birthday on 20th February, which just
added to the excitement that Python had come to the Caribbean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brandon spoke of the weirdness that occurs when English meets Spanish,
when the English ask, what is that called?  "Rio Grande" comes the
response.  And from then on it is known as the tautological &lt;em&gt;Rio
Grande River&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brandon went through some of the history of the python language and
how its design was shaped by other languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python, like all modern computer languaes, or indeed languages in
general, is a mash-up of ideas borrowed from other languages.  Indeed,
computer languages borrow idioms from natural language all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the power and elegance of python comes not from the features
it has adopted, but from those it has chosen not to implement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;History was a theme in many talks.  I find an understanding of the
history can be very illuminating in understanding how we got to where
we are and why things are how they are now.  It can also be a guide to
the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just ten days ago the world of science had been buzzing with the
announcement of the LIGO experiments detection of gravitational waves
from two black holes, each the mass of more than 30 Suns, colliding
over 1 billion light years away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What has since emerged is the extent to which python was involved in
the incredible data analyis that has been able to detect a wrinkle in
space time less than the width of a proton as it passed by the earth
from a billion light years away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world of physics has finally moved on from Fortran to python.
Brandon joked that physicists only change language once every 50
years, so this is a significant transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the speed of the transition has caught many by surprise.  And
its not just astro-physics, but many other disciplines: biological
science, finance, weather and climate, geologists, signal processing,
humanities and so much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Driving much of this are wonderful tools, in particular, Jupyter
notebook, matplotlib, ipython and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, the tools have reached the point where regardless of your
discipline you can quickly learn just enough to quickly investigate
ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="python-as-a-way-of-thinking"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Python as a way of Thinking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allen Downey talked about thinking in python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He talked about expressing thoughts in natural language, mathematics
and computer code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we write computer code we are turning mathematics into something
that computers can run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The language of mathematics is neither executable or easy for humans
to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural language is rich, but ambiguous and not executable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python has often been described as executable pseudo-code, and with
good reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allen showed how to move from the world of mathematics and build from
the bottom up to a natural interface to your idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A highlight of this talk for me was his wonderful transalation of
Bayes theorem into python.  I will watch out for the code appearing on
github and post a link when it turns up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="code-review-revision-and-technical-debt"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Code Review, Revision and Technical Debt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geoff Gerrietts followed Allen's talk with a lot of good advice on the
benefits of code review, dealing with technical debt and much, much
more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="supercomputing-with-python"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Supercomputing with python&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Logston was another speaker who illustrated the subject with some
history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his case, this was a brief history of super-computers since the
first Cray-1 in 1976.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparisons in FLOPs (floating-point operations) are only part of the
story, but do give a useful yardstick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1976 Cray-1: 160 mega-flops&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1984 Cray-XMP, 4 cpu's, ~1 giga-flop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2013 Tihane, 34 peta-flops, 32,000 intel Xeons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Tihane has roughly the power of 34 million Cray XMP's.  Note
however, that much of this increase comes from scaling up the number
of processors.  To take advantage of this power, your problem needs to
be amenable to parallel processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul showed how to write simple code using python interfaces to MPI
(message passing interface) to write code to run on these massively
parallel machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul just does this in his spare time, helping a friend with
biological science problems related to DNA and RNA, he just happens to
have access to a supercomputer to test his code on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="keynote-django-ladies"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Keynote: Django Ladies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ola Sitarska told of her adventure with the django web framework and
how the Django Ladies came into being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The python world is full of tales like this, someone seeing a need,
figuring out how to help others and creating tools, documentation and
training to build communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Django ladies have now run training across the globe.  Their tutorials
have been read by hundreds of thousands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ola recognised the challenges for women trying to enter a tech world
dominated by men and provided tips and guides to help them succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tech communities have long lacked diversity, PyCaribbean has added
another dimension by helping foster community across the Caribbean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="documentation"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Documentation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second and final day began with Eric Holscher's keynote on
documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric created readthedocs and more recently writethedocs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documentation is fundamental to making your code accessible to
others.  And in six months time, even it it is your own code, you will
be glad that you wrote the docs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, there was some history of the world of python documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integration of documentation generation into automated build processes
has been a major driver in helping documentation stay in sync with
code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Django project was mentioned as a project with a process that
positively fosters documentation generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric mentioned some new developments, including new tools which are
able to extract docstrings from code without having to import (and
hence partially execute) that code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric showed some photos of hundreds of documenation enthusiasts
working together at readthedocs gatherings.  Who knew, 300 people
giving up their time to work together on free software documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I particularly enjoyed this talk as I have a keen interest in
documentation driven development and literate programming ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="virtual-reality"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Virtual Reality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jose Elias gave a fascinating account of the world of virtual
and augmented reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this talk, virtual reality was focussed on
technology that presents virtual worlds using headsets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jose gave a history of the subject.  Like many technology developments
early enthusiam ran into technical issues and the subject was
abandonned for a few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As technology has caught up, we are reaching a new era of rapid
development of VR technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Headsets are becoming:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lightweight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;low power&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;low latency, little lag as your head moves around&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;higher resolution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lower cost&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of excitement in the tech world, with a belief that VR
may prove to be as disruptive, if not more so, than smart phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst much of the technology is proprietary there are also some
significant open source tools, including python of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This technology can, and probably will, fundamentally change how
humans interact with computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One video showed someone creating a virtual vase and placing it in a
3-D printer which then created a real version of the vase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="machine-learning-in-python"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Machine learning in python&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick McClure gave some excellent advise on the challenges of working
with machine learning and encorporating models into a production
environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this talk immediately preceded my own, I missed a lot and look
forward to catching up when the video comes out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="as-much-typing-as-you-want"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;As much typing as you want&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy Fundinger gave a clearly illustrated talk on how python
properties can be used to coerce data to specific types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He began with an overview of how types work in python and the typical
ways pythonistas interact with types.  The most common approach is to
just ignore them altogether, just go with the duck-typing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the beauties of python is that it allows you to probe around in
its internals.  Done carefully, this can be very powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy did not use meta-classes for his tricks, but did raise the
possibility, noting that &lt;em&gt;Traits&lt;/em&gt; use this approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is something I tend to avoid as you are changing the &lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt;
behaviour of python classes.  For instance,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy noted that the decision to take this route is best decided
up-front for a specific framework, being expliicit about just what
tricks are being used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also gave some helpful advice on how to do this on a minimally
invasive way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came away with a new trick that may well prove very useful in some
future projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="building-the-caribbean-python-community"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Building the Caribbean Python Community&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had an extended lunch break talking with others from Jamaica, Puerto
Rico and of course the Dominican Republic about how to spread this
community across the Caribbean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I am aware, I was the only attendee from Bermuda.  With only
65,000 residents, it is challenging to get the critical mass to hold
regular events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others are experiencing similar problems on their islands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We discussed ways to work together and pool resources as well as
virtual meet-ups and of course further conferences and gatherings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is excellent support from the wider Python community and a very
promissing future for Python in the Caribbean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will undoubtedly be another PyCaribbean in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are also starting to explore ideas for a PyData conference in
Bermuda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="jacob-kaplan-moss-closing-keynote"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Jacob Kaplan-Moss Closing Keynote&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacob gave the closing keynote extending the ideas from his PyCon 2015
keynote in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He explored ideas about how people become experts.  He referred to
research which has shown a lack of evidence of genetic
pre-disposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He noted that in today's world what we generally need is not
individual experts but rather expert teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the problems we face require a multi-disciplinary approach.
No one individual can hope to know everything and the collective
knowledge and skills of any group is always greater than any
individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge is how to build expert teams.  Jacob identified some of
the key factors that teams that learn quickly have over those that
struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacob used data from a research project analysing teams which had been
put together to carry out non-invasive heart surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teams improved quickly when:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the team members are kept the same initially&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;introduce new members slowly with mentoring from the existing
members.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keep the process the same initially (as opposed to a less successful
team where the lead liked to introduce something new each time).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have a team review each procedure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;members are chosen based on their ability to work together well,
rather than just going with who is interested or available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another talk where I look forward to the video, there is much
to digest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="wrap-up-and-after-party"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap up and after party&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is carnival time in Santo Domingo, the streets were full of people
in exotic costumes for the carnival, each Sunday in February is party
time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good time was had by all at the after party at Pasteur 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two days of fun and learning with a wonderful group of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am already looking forward to PyCaribbean 2017 wherever it may be
held.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>bermuda</category><category>caribbean</category><category>python</category><guid>http://openbermuda.github.io/80days/posts/pycaribbean.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Feb 2016 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>New Bermuda Government Web Site</title><link>http://openbermuda.github.io/80days/posts/new-bermuda-government-web-site.html</link><dc:creator>Johnny Gill</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In last week's thrown speech the government announced that a new
government web site will be created in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="why-is-a-new-website-needed"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why is a new website needed?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The existing government websites are built on top of proprietary
technologies such as Adobe Flash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would seem the government does not own the code to its own
websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contracts were put out to tender, the winning bid invariably ends up
owning the code.  This locks the government into expensive support
contracts from the same contractors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Systems become unsupportable if built on top of proprietary technology
that itself reaches end of life or if the contractor that owns the
code goes out of business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="free-software-and-open-data"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Free Software and Open Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free software is software that gives its users the freedom to examine,
modify, change and re-distribute the software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are now millions of free software projects and the vast majority
of successful technology companies are building their products with
free software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is widely accepted in technology circles that the free and open
development methodology results in higher quality software, lower
total cost of ownership and more control for users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open data is a related concept.  Data is made freely available and
searchable by all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other jurisdictions have embraced open data, appointed open data
advocates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have run open data book clubs and hackathons to inform their
citizens of the data that is available and invite development of
innovative new tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="will-the-government-consider-free-and-open-source-solutions"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Will the government consider free and open source solutions?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many jurisdictions now mandate that solutions be built with free and
open software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others insist that free and open source solutions are given fair
consideration in the bidding process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will the Bermuda government be looking at free software solutions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="will-the-government-insist-it-has-control-of-the-code-for-its-own-website"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Will the government insist it has control of the code for its own website?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will the government ensure it has control over the code running on its
own websites?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="will-the-government-empower-the-community-to-contribute"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Will the government empower the community to contribute?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a growing community of free software enthusiasts in Bermuda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will the government support that community by involving it in the
design and development of the new website?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will it involve schools and the Bermuda college in the design and
development of its websites?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will it empower its people to contribute to their own systems?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will it open up the process to wide discussion and provide funds to
sponsor the best ideas?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="will-the-government-support-open-data-initiatives"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Will the government support open data initiatives?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other jurisdictions have demonstrated the value of making citizen's
data freely available and usable by the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will the government embrace &lt;em&gt;open by default&lt;/em&gt;.  Data will be open
unless there is a compelling reason to keep it secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noting that securing data on today's computers is extremely difficult,
will the government take steps to reduce to a minimum the amount of
sensitive data it stores?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="will-the-government-involve-the-community-in-privacy-and-open-data-discussions"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Will the government involve the community in privacy and open data discussions?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Privacy and information security affect everyone living on the
island.  Will the government invite contributions from the community
and an informed discussion about what data should be stored on
computers and who should have access to that data?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>bermuda</category><category>free software</category><category>open source</category><guid>http://openbermuda.github.io/80days/posts/new-bermuda-government-web-site.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 16 Nov 2015 16:55:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Magic Roundabouts and Geese</title><link>http://openbermuda.github.io/80days/posts/magic-roundabouts-and-geese.html</link><dc:creator>Johnny Gill</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up as children we would watch The Magic Roundabout on the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a five minute children's program with a carousel, Zebedee,
Dougal the dog and Dylan the rabbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each episode ended with Zebedee saying, "Time for bed", before
springing off, literally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we got older we might watch a bit of the news that followed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="roundabouts-around-the-world"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Roundabouts around the world&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the world, traffic rules vary quite a bit.  Here are some
examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="france"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;France&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In France roundabouts used to be much less common than in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early traffic rule was essentially, "priorite a la droite".  This
rule dated back to horses and carriages and mostly they could see each
other coming for a good way, it was simple to slow down and give way
to those from one side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another key rule, is which side of the road to drive on.  The French,
like most of continental Europe, drive on the right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looked at from above, the French go anti-clockwise around
roundabouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when they arrive at one, those already on the roundabout give way
to new arrivals, coming from the right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This works well with light traffic.  With heavy draffic, things can
fall apart: once the roundabout is full of cars nobody can go
anywhere, although if you are just taking the first right then you'll
probably be ok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="arc-de-triomphe"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Arc de Triomphe&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this is more like The Magic Roundabout.  I have no idea what the
rules are.   Rumour has it that insurance companies exclude any
accident that happens here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="british-isles"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;British Isles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here they drive on the left and go clockwise round roundabouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You give way to those already on the roundabout.  Those already on can
keep going, those arriving have to wait for it to be safe to enter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, like the French you are giving way to those on the right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, it can work well it depends on the traffic volume and pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="swindon"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Swindon&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swindon actually has a Magic Roundabout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a crazy construction of five roundabouts with another roundabout
inside them all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UK rules apply, so once you get on the thing it is like a
roller-coaster, just go with the flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the accidents happen, people are usually moving pretty slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="north-america"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;North America&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roundabouts used to be far less common in North America.  Four-way
stops are the order of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You arrive at the junction and stop.  If no-one else is there then you
can proceed, others arriving after you should give way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this can lead to the &lt;em&gt;Canadian stand-off&lt;/em&gt;.   You arrive at a
roundabout just as someone else arrives.  There then follows an
elaborate dance where you both just sit there waiting for the other to
go first, often accompanied by hand-gestures.   Dead-lock is not
uncommon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="ottawa"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Ottawa&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a roundabout near the Experimental Farm that itself seems to
be a wonderful experiment in mixing British and French roundabout
rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the day it was probably a four way stop, a simple cross-roads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's pretend there is a north-south (NS) road crossing east-west (EW)
and the NS is the bigger road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are travelling NS or SN, you can pretent your are French and
drive straight on to the roundabout.  Those coming from an EW
direction will give way to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are turning left, then you will have to give way to traffic
entering on the NS road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if you arrive on the EW road you have to give way to traffic
already on the roundabout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is a complicated mixture of giving way to the left or right
depending on where you are on the roundabout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="going-backwards-round-the-magic-roundabout"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Going backwards round the magic roundabout&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;* please don't try this *&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traffic arriving from east (or west) could do a Pierre Trudeau, behind
the Queen pirouette, turning 180 degrees to enter the roundabout
backwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this way, the &lt;em&gt;give way to traffic on your right&lt;/em&gt; rule ensures the
traffic that you need to giver way to is always coming from your right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once on the roundabout another pirouette should be done, having done
this, again give way to traffic entering from the North/South road,
which is again on your right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also ensures if you exit on this route you are facing the right
way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If continuing around the roundabout, another pirouette should be
performed after passing the north/south road.  Hence, you will again
be going backwards on the magic roundabout.   With your right side to
the centre of the roundabout there is no need to give way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was much younger my mother one night announced she felt a
little typsy.  As a curious child I asked what that was like.  She
said, "it is like I am going backwards on the magic roundabout".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said, don't try this on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="johnny-barnes"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Johnny Barnes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hamilton, Bermuda there are several roundabouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is one special one.  It is known as The Johnny Barnes
roundabout and has its own magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is indeed magic.  Every weekday, between 5am and 10am you will see
Johnny Barnes.  He has been waving to traffic and dispensing love
at the roundabout since retiring from the Bus company.  He is now in
his 90's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bermuda has its own road rules.  Mostly following the British.  But
the horn only really gets used to say &lt;em&gt;hi&lt;/em&gt; to friends and cousins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you see a friend trying to get out of a small side road you might
well follow the "priorite a la droite" rule and wave for them to go
ahead of you, even though you have right of way.  The roads are
narrow, the speed limit is 20 mph and a little give and take makes it
a better place for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you are new to the island, watch out for vehicles stopping to let
people out of tiny driveways and side roads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-about-the-geese"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What about the geese?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week the Mighty Blades played Swindon.  Those brave fans that
made the journey down to Swindon went there knowing they would have to
negotiate the Magic Roundabout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being Blades fans, they were probably expecting the worst and a heavy
defeat.  I believe all the fans got through the roundabout unscathed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the game, well the new manager, Nigel Adkins, played a
motivational video before the game.  Google "geese sufc" and you
should find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It explains how geese are able to travel 70% further by flying in a V
formation.  How one goose will lead and when tired drop back into the
formation and let another take the lead.d&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a goose is tiring and struggling, two other strong geese will drop
down to the ocean with the struggler and stay with it until it either
dies or makes a recovery.  They will then fly together to rejoin the
flock, or tag onto another flock following behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="magic-roundabouts-and-mother-geese"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Magic Roundabouts and Mother Geese&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was younger, my mum was my Magic Roundabout.  She would watch
the world circling around her and find ways to change the paths of
those that needed to be on a different path, or gently put together
those that would benefit from each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now have another Magic Roundabout in my life.  Mum's are magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>bermuda</category><category>blades</category><category>france</category><category>ottawa</category><category>roundabouts</category><category>sufc</category><category>swindon</category><guid>http://openbermuda.github.io/80days/posts/magic-roundabouts-and-geese.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 04 Sep 2015 14:54:08 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Census Survey</title><link>http://openbermuda.github.io/80days/posts/census-survey.html</link><dc:creator>Johnny Gill</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="section" id="introduction"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bermuda Government, Department of Statistics has put out a Request
for Proposal (RFP) for a &lt;em&gt;web-based solution to support on-line
census&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are some thoughts on how Free Software could form the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The census raises many complex issues of privacy, accessibility and
access to information.  In short, is has all the features of a
typical software project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="free-software-solution"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Free Software Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most, if not all, of the pieces required to build this system already
exist as free software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This software is free in the sense that it gives you freedom.  Freedom
to examine the software, freedom to look how it works, freedom to
change it as you wish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freedom to pass the software on to others should you wish, so long as
you give them the same freedoms you received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A prototype can be built from these pieces in around 20 hours of
development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are Bermudians with the skills to do this and the time to devote
to such a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases they will be exploring new concepts, but that is the
nature of IT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many others they can call on to assist should they need
guidance, including the millions of people around the globe who
contribute to free software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="accessibility"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Accessibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accessibility is often neglected in software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many free software tools have good support for accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, a framework is provided to address a wide range of
accessibility issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone has different challenges working with computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hearing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;motor movements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;speech&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;language processing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reading&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;writing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the software itself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;citizens access to information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bermuda is an international island.  English is the dominant
language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documents are generally produced in English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the island has many nationalities living here and also has
many Bermudians who have travelled and lived abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also distinct communities within Bermuda with their own
language, culture and history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, of course, Bermuda is a popular travel destination, with many
nationalities paying visits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet there is very poor support for languages other than English on
most Bermuda related websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A free software solution would accommodate translations.  Further, it
would allow anyone to contribute to those translations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free software: means you can adapt for differing needs, since you have
the code.  Without the code you are tied to a third party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further others can help you.  A free software census solution for
Bermuda may be usable in many other juristictions.  Bermudians who
develop such software would be able to work with others wherever in
the world they may be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="public-access-to-information"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Public Access To Information&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Census data is invaluable in many ways.  It provides data that can
guide public policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TODO: Anology: vaccination: having your children vaccinated protects
them against illness, but also reduces the chance of epidemics
breaking out.  There are small risks to every vaccination, but the
benefits to society can be significant.  For example, consider the
elimination of polio, a disease that affect large numbers of people in
the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the UK there have been censuses since 1831 (may have been earlier).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collecting the data back in that day was a huge task.  At the time it
gave vast amounts of information about poplulation sizes, household
sizes and the age profile of the population and their occupations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the data was hand written.  Pages of data might have totals and
there were presumably clerks creating aggregate statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, genealogists find the census data both fascinating and
invaluable as they trace family history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK has been digitising this data over the last few years and
making it available on line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A free software solution to the census would anticipate PATI requests
by building access to information into the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than wait for PATI requests and have to then examine data to
see what should be released, the decisions about what should be
released, when and to who will be made up front and built into the
solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A system can be built that will only release certain information after
some specified period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some data may need reviewing after some number of years and released
or re-sealed based on that review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="transparency-and-privacy"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Transparency and Privacy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is assumed that aggregate data from the census will be made freely
available to citizens.  Our solution will include support for such
access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is recommended that any data of a sensitive nature be treated
appropriately, including the physical security of any computers
storing the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One possibility is to try to build a system that only stores
aggregrate information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should also be noted that in a small community like Bermuda
aggregate data, especially when combined with other similar data can
remove annonynimity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One recommendation would be to encourage community discussion about
the census questions and have the community guide the decisions
regarding privacy and access to information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collecting more personal data that will be stored in some sort of time
capsule for the benefit of future historians and genealogy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="computer-insecurity"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Computer insecurity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In view of all the high profile data breaches that the world has been
experiencing over recent months it should be apparent that storing
sensitive data on computers is not an easy task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our solution will recognise this fact and propose appropriate measures
for storing more sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it would be our recommendation to only collect data that the
residents of Bermuda are comfortable in sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="maintenance-and-development"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Maintenance and Development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a free software solution future maintenance and development of
the software can be performed by anyone with the skills.  The local
poplulation will have all the tools they need, they just need to learn
the skills needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, a well designed free software census would be usable in other
jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If developed here in Bermuda by Bermudians it would create
opportunities for the team to work elsewhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="free-software-centre"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Free Software Centre&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="ownership-of-code"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ownership of code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government, not the developers would own and code developed for
the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be noted most of the code already exists and is free
software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is suggested that any code written for the project be itself
released as a free software project using the GPL license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="appendix-project-jupyter"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Appendix:  Project Jupyter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans in different parts of the world speak different languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans have also developed many different languages for communicating
with computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning these languages can take considerable time and effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most of the history of modern computing, communicating with other
languages has been difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In effect, the plethora of languages has worked to Balkanise the IT
world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://jupyter.org/"&gt;Project Jupyter&lt;/a&gt; is just one project that is helping languages work
together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jupyter is a tool that supports virtually seamless interoperability
between 50 different languages, from python, to perl, C++ to C#, Bash
to Brainfuck, erlang to lua, matlab to php.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="choosing-tools"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Choosing tools&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers invariably like to use the tools they know best.  They
understand them, know what they are capable of and know many of the
risks they will encounter using those tools to solve a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting a project with a new tool presents many additional risks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;will it work as advertised?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much time will it take to learn?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an organisation starting out in the free software world the choice
can be daunting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, any large organisation will likely end up using many
different languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst there are inefficiencies in this approach, there are
advantages, just as with growing crops: monoculture leaves an
organisation vulnerable to anything which threatens that ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Variety gives resilience, but at some cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Projects such as Jupyter help support that variety and reduce the
costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a particular technology choice is proving hard to support, porting
to another Jupyter supported language is always an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The week 10th to 18th October 2015 there is a lot happening in Bermuda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;TEDx Bermuda on 10th October&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;America's Cup racing 16th-18th October&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first anniversary of hurricanes Fay and Gonzalo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates a good opportunity to run a number of small events around
&lt;a href="http://openbermuda.github.io/80days/posts/d-bermuda-pi.html"&gt;Free Software&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://openbermuda.github.io/80days/posts/d-bermuda-pi.html"&gt;Free Culture&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics &lt;a href="http://openbermuda.github.io/80days/posts/d-bermuda-pi.html"&gt;STEM&lt;/a&gt; is already
getting a lot of attention.  This is natural in a world where there is
so much innovation and change in current times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout my life technological change has created a lot of wonderful
things.  At the same time, humanity and social systems are struggling
to keep pace with this change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://openbermuda.github.io/80days/posts/d-bermuda-pi.html"&gt;STEAM&lt;/a&gt; adds the Arts into STEM.  Making the Bermuda $\pi$ a STEAM
powered event seems a natural choice, as the event can then embrace
Bermudian culture in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, a hurricane can be viewed as a giant steam engine.
Bermuda once ran a steam powered island.  How about bringing this to
the 21st century:  &lt;em&gt;D Bermuda $\pi$, STEAM powered&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id="Free-Culture"&gt;Free Culture&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="http://openbermuda.github.io/80days/posts/d-bermuda-pi.html#Free-Culture"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;People in the free software movement have been dealing with this
change for some time.  They have developed ways of working with
technology that not only scale, but also enable people to build
systems that evolve naturally over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a more general Free Culture movement, publishing artistic
material under &lt;a href="http://openbermuda.github.io/80days/posts/d-bermuda-pi.html"&gt;Creative Commons&lt;/a&gt; licenses that mirror the free
software licenses.  Generally, these licenses allow others to build on
the ideas and use them in their own work, usually with attribution.
Some licenses do not permit commercial use, but many do.  Authors

&lt;p&gt;Aim for most presentations to be about activities that are going on
already in Bermuda, with some visions for future projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invite others from overseas that are doing similar work.  Better
still, people we are already collaborating with on Bermuda projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus on the Bermuda context: why is what you are doing a good fit for
Bermuda, how can it fit better?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that one theme of &lt;code&gt;D Bermuda Pi&lt;/code&gt; will be hurricane research it
would be unfortunate if the event were hit by a hurricane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, it would give the researchers valuable first hand experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One project to work on during the week would be getting better
estimates of the probability of the event being hit by bad weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use long term climate features such as El Nino, the North Atlantic
Oscillation, and the Bermuda High to help with contingency planning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Develop tools that can help with future event planning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study detailed windfields around the island to better understand the
challenges faced by the sailors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study tides and currents around the island&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://openbermuda.github.io/80days/posts/d-bermuda-pi.html"&gt;Murphy's Law&lt;/a&gt; is likely to intervene here, so in the meanwhile it
would be good if we kept an eye on the long range hurricane forecasts
and nearer the time be in a position to work with Bermuda Weather and
have plans in place in the event of bad weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="Paget-Island"&gt;Paget Island&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="http://openbermuda.github.io/80days/posts/d-bermuda-pi.html#Paget-Island"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paget Island is one of a number of Government run islands.  It has
basic facilities.  It would make an excellent venue for a coding
sprint focussing on the environment and sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bermuda is an expensive place to visit, some free sofware enthusiasts
would be more than happy to come and camp on the island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One goal would be to make this as inclusive an event as possible,
hence creating many different activities that will appeal to different
demographics, but also to find ways to mix those people and give them
new experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The buildings and infrastructure on Paget Island are in need of some
TLC.  It would be good to work towards building a place run on
renewable energy, environmentally positive where people can come to
study how we are doing things in Bermuda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The philosophy of a camp on the island would be to leave the place
better than it is found.&lt;/p&gt;

in 80 days* idea, to run little competitions where people get miles
(or kilometers) for activities.  The idea is to see how far round the
world you can get in 80 days, with fun twists along the way.
One idea was to do an &lt;em&gt;Around Bermuda on Bermuda Bus and Ferry&lt;/em&gt;
competition.  I learnt a lot on the project, but never quite got it
out of the door.  But that is another story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a version still limping along on heroku: &lt;a href="https://tonzone80days.herokuapp.com/"&gt;https://tonzone80days.herokuapp.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kudos to heroku.  I have a half build project running there, haven't
checked it in ages and boom it springs into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some other pieces coming together that might make the bus
thing viable in the near future, just needs a bit of time applied to
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that I found useful in the project was thinking in an 80 day
time horizon.  So I was curious about what date is 80 days before 10th
October 2015, the date for the start of the Bermuda $\pi$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hitting &lt;em&gt;Home&lt;/em&gt; on the &lt;a href="https://tonzone80days.herokuapp.com/"&gt;https://tonzone80days.herokuapp.com/&lt;/a&gt; shows me this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jun 29, 2015 is today's date&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sep 17, 2015 is 80 days from today&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apr 10, 2015 was 80 days ago&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So time for a little python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="What's-this-*Number-$-e^{i\pi}$-thing-about?"&gt;What's this *Number $-e^{i\pi}$ thing about?&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="http://openbermuda.github.io/80days/posts/d-bermuda-pi.html#What's-this-*Number-%24-e%5E%7Bi%5Cpi%7D%24-thing-about?"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a wonderful equation in mathematics that links some of the key
constants from the world of mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is $\pi$, the ratio between a circle's diameter and its
circumference. $\pi$ turns up all the time in mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there is &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both $\pi$ and $e$ are transcendental, a special type of number,
although there are an infinite number of transendental numbers, when
they turn up in mathematics they tend to be important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there is 1.  The special number that you can multiply any other
number by and leave it unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there is 0.  The special number you can add to anything and leave it unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The equation is known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_identity"&gt;Euler's identity&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
$$ e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0 $$&lt;p&gt;As this would be the first Bermuda $\pi$ it would:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Bermuda-$\pi$-Number-1-=-$-e^{i\pi}$"&gt;Bermuda $\pi$ Number 1 = $-e^{i\pi}$&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="http://openbermuda.github.io/80days/posts/d-bermuda-pi.html#Bermuda-%24%5Cpi%24-Number-1-=-%24-e%5E%7Bi%5Cpi%7D%24"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's make it number one, every year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

give Bermuda's public transport users up to date information on where
the buses and ferries actually are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transit authorities that have made this data available have found a
number of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.actsoft.com/public-transportation-profits-from-gps-tracking/"&gt;benefits&lt;/a&gt; of bus tracking, including increased usage of
public transport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a thriving open source project, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://onebusaway.org/"&gt;One Bus Away&lt;/a&gt; which looks
like it could be used in the Bermuda environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A first step in getting the transport data into the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference"&gt;General Transit
Feed Specification&lt;/a&gt; (GTFS) format.  This provides a flexible format
for transit data.  It is how you specify bus stop locations, routes
and timetables.  Once you have your data in this format there are a
number of projects that you can use to create a powerful transit
application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://onebusaway.org/"&gt;One Bus Away&lt;/a&gt; project is an open source project that is being
used in a number of US and Canadian cities.  It should be usable here
in Bermuda too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google provides good support for transit information and the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2015/06/the-netherlands-debuts-new-google-public-transport-service/"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; recently became the first country in the world to
provide full information via their service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst this support from Google is good to have, since many tourists
will be using google maps whilst visiting the island, there are
benefits to being in control of your own data and websites.  There are
restrictions on the use of Google maps and you are not in control of
future development when you use that platform.  Further, users may not
wish to share their location with Google due to privacy concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=bermuda#map=12/32.2949/-64.7830"&gt;OpenStreetMap&lt;/a&gt; is an free and open project to make top quality
digital maps available.  The Bermuda map is quite excellent.  Further,
there is a good open source javascript library, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://leafletjs.com/"&gt;leaflet&lt;/a&gt; to create
interactive maps using OpenStreetMap data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months back Open Bermuda started work on a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/openbermuda/wheres-de-bus"&gt;Where's de bus&lt;/a&gt;
project during a hackathon.  The challenge at that time was finding
out where the actual bus stops were.  It is hoped that it will be
possible to get this information and full bus and ferry timetables in
machine readable form from the Bermuda Transportation Board (BTB).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the small size of Bermuda and its transit network it would also
be possible to crowd-source the data for a transit application.  If
live GPS data is not avaialable from BTB an alternative would be to
create a mobile application that public transport users could run and
use to report bus locations as well as how full the bus currently is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are already some open source GPS tracking systems available such
as &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.opengts.org/"&gt;OpenGTS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.traccar.org/"&gt;Traccar&lt;/a&gt; that might be usable here.&lt;/p&gt;

point during your trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the biggest and busiest of the South Shore beaches.
Whenever there is a long weekend things will be happening on Horseshoe
Bay, such as the annual Good Friday flying of kites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Horseshoe Bay you can walk along the coast, past a number of
smaller and quieter beaches and coves.  Often you will be able to find
a beach to yourself, with pink sands, turquoise water and tropical
fish swimming around the reefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the top of the driveway that leads down to Horseshoe Bay you will
find Southampton Rangers football and cricket club.  On the weekend
you might be able to watch some cricket and get some refreshment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a restaurant, Gulf Stream where you can get a bite to
eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less than a couple of hundred yards to the west you will find a small
side-road, Turtle Place.  This is where local artist Sharon Wilson
lives.  Her home is also her studio and her gallery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If she is open for visitors she usually puts out a &lt;em&gt;sandwich board&lt;/em&gt; at
the end of the road, sometimes with a couple of balloons attached.  In
that case, you are in luck.  She will welcome you to her home and let
you discover her art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a copy of a book she produced, here is the cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="../galleries/SharonWilson/book_cover.jpg" src="http://openbermuda.github.io/80days/galleries/SharonWilson/book_cover.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 400px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My cat seems to like the book too:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a story behind everything she paints.  She will tell you some
of those stories, but also let you find your own story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is another picture, it has a good story too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="../galleries/SharonWilson/father_and_daughter.jpg" src="http://openbermuda.github.io/80days/galleries/SharonWilson/father_and_daughter.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 400px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>art</category><category>bermuda</category><guid>http://openbermuda.github.io/80days/posts/sharon-wilson.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 24 May 2015 15:40:38 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Bermuda 3 Bahamas 0</title><link>http://openbermuda.github.io/80days/posts/bermuda-3-bahamas-0.html</link><dc:creator>Johnny Gill</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This afternoon Bermuda were playing Bahamas in a World Cup qualifier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the second leg, but Bermuda, led by Nahki Wells, were already
5-0 win in the Bahamas last Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This game hadn't been generally broadcast in Bermuda.  But we had seen
highlights, and the first many of us knew about the game was via a
banner that was put out on the TV station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a long suffering supporter of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield_United_F.C."&gt;Mighty Blades&lt;/a&gt; I have rarely
been in the position of being able to go to a game, already 5-0 up.  I
have also never been to a World Cup game before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So today we set off early to the game on the moped.  The game was a
sell out, parking was likely to be tricky.  In any case, the build up
to the game would likely be fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was cold.  Not Canada cold, but Bermuda cold.  Cloudy and damp,
windy and looked like it could rain any minute.  The rain held off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The build up to the game was fun too.  Many in the crowd knew one or
more of the players well.  There was excitement that we would see a
few goals, and a slight fear that maybe things could unravel.  And
there were Gombeys :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bermuda did dominate the game from start to finish.  The goalkeeper,
Fredrick Hall, was substited at half-time.  I am guessing that he was
frozen, as the ball boys had all had a lot more work to do.  It was
a good time to give his back-up a chance to play, and he at least had
some saves to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nahki Wells won a penalty, then crashed the resulting kick against the
cross-bar.  This was close to half-time, Bermuda had already had 5-6
really good chances, but the ball didn't want to go in the net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier Wells had been fouled, about 30 yards out and needed treatment
from the physio.  He was then made to leave the field, and was not
able to be there for the free-kick that required the treatment.
Broken rules?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justi Donawa had what looked like a painful injury to his foot, and
had to be replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second half was more of the same, but Bermuda were increasingly
getting the feeling that it was going to end 0-0.  The players felt it
and the crowd too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Nahki Wells broke through and this time made no mistake, 1-0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this point every time Bermuda went forward, and that was
frequently, they looked like scoring.  The game ended 3-0.  The Gombey
Warriors will play Guatemala, away on the 8th of June, at home on the
16th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two last things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is a very young Bermuda team.  I heard the average age is
just 21.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Bahamas also have a young team.  They played a good game today,
the game flowed, there were lots of entertaining moments.  It can't
have been easy travelling away already 5-0 down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a great afternoon, two teams, refs and the crowd all played
their part.  Looking forward to the next games.&lt;/p&gt;

Canada.  They were having difficulty understanding why I am thinking
it was so cold here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've lived in many places, but including hard Ottawa winters, but
never felt as cold as Bermuda the last few weeks.  It is all
perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had good times while they were here, below is just one of those
days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pink-and-blue-limo"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pink and blue limo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'd decided to go to Spittal Pond.  As we are down the west end of
the island, that means 2 buses, or &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://openbermuda.github.io/80days/posts/the-pink-and-blue-limo.rst"&gt;the pink and blue limo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were in luck, the number 7 bus pulled up just as we reached the
stop.  A sunny day, so the views along South Shore were spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were soon in town and just had a bit of time between buses to look
at Victoria Park and the web of ropes holding up trees that have been
lifted back up since the hurricanes knocked them over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onto the number 1 bus and another beautiful journey.  You are higher
up on the bus, and see so a lot more.  Plus it stops every now and
again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="spittal-pond"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Spittal Pond&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="../galleries/SpittalPond/20150221_132114.jpg" src="http://openbermuda.github.io/80days/galleries/SpittalPond/20150221_132114.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have liked Spittal Pond for a lot of years.  It is a place in
Bermuda where you can really feel in a natural environment.
Spectactular views and lots to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also a place that changes through the seasons, so there is
always something new to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the first time I had been since the hurricanes.  There wasn't
much sign of them on this walk.  Just a fiew views that didn't used to
exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we were treated to a sunny day without much wind.  The ocean
always looks better in the sun.  It lights up the clarity of the water
and the pink sand beneath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The path leads down to some rocks where in a few places there are
actually steps cut out to make it a little easier to clamber over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the waters edge there were a couple of large parrot fish, bobbing
around as the waves were breaking against the rocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="../galleries/SpittalPond/20150221_140921.jpg" src="http://openbermuda.github.io/80days/galleries/SpittalPond/20150221_140921.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="portuguese-rock"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Portuguese Rock&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took the little detour up to a rocky cliff overlooking the ocean.
Here there is a brass plate that is a cast of an inscription that was
found on the rock here.  It has the date 1543 and some other marks
that have been interpretted as "R. P." standing for Rex Portugaline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1543 is nearly 70 years before the island was settled, indicating that
there is more to the early history of this island than we are every
likely to discover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="../galleries/SpittalPond/20150221_133042.jpg" src="http://openbermuda.github.io/80days/galleries/SpittalPond/20150221_133042.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-farm-on-mcgalls-hill"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The farm on McGalls Hill&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once back at the road we decided to walk over the hill, past St Mark's
church and down McGall's Hill to the Northrock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part way down the hill we stopped to look at a small banana
plantation.  The farmer, Henry, and his wife, Theresa, were there
looking after the land and invited us down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henry delighted in telling us just what is invoved in growing
bananas.  He also showed us onions, giant cloves of garlic and new
potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They had such patience in showing how all the different plants
thrived.  Henry also told us about the fruit salad tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citrus fruit used to be a big thing in Bermuda.  If you visit the
island ask an older Bermudian about the citrus and they will tell you
Bermuda used to have some of the best citrus fruit you can find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henry explained that you can even grow fruit salad trees here: a
single tree that grows lemons, limes, oranges and grapefruit, all as a
result of grafting buts from different fruits onto a wild lemon base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, it was a great day.&lt;/p&gt;
