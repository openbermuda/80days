future in a world where robots and software algorithms have the
potential to replace vast numbers of existing jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technological advances resulting in job losses is not a new thing.
However, Martin argues that this time may be different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst previous advances have resulted in whole industries
disappearing, new ones have replaced them and fears of a jobless
future have proven to be unfounded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue this time is machines and algorithms are starting to emulate
human brains and potentially threaten not just manual jobs, but also
white collar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin lives in California and works in IT.  As such, the book is very
much written from a US perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="inequality"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inequality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a fair bit of discussion of the rising inequality in the
world, illustrated with statistics from the Federal Reserve Bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, since the 1970's there has been rising productivity but no
corresponding rise in wages.  Technology has enabled people to be more
productive, but this increased productivity has resulted in larger
corporate profits rather than rising wages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hard to escape the feeling that this rising inequality is a
greater issue than technology making jobs redundant, but the two
issues together have the potential to have dangerous consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To some extent, this rising inequality has been mitigated by the lower
costs of production as many people's purchasing power has not been
significantly reduced due lower prices in real terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin argues that as more and more jobs are replaced only a highly
educated elite will be able to command employment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="globalisation"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Globalisation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporations have access to a global workforce and have moved
production to areas where labour costs are lower.  At the same time,
this overseas competition has helped supress local wages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workers in developing nations are perhaps more of a threat to existing
jobs than robots and algorithms, at least in the short term.  Further,
these regions are getting more sophisticated and more technical jobs
are starting to disappear overseas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, increased automation is making local production more
competitive with overseas workers.  However, these highly automated
factories require very much less labour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="expert-systems"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Expert systems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book gives many examples of sophisticated algorithms, such as
Google's automatic translation tools and the IBM Watson computer that
was able to win at the Jeopardy game.&lt;/p&gt;
