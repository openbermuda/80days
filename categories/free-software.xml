&lt;h2&gt;What&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in computing, hardware, software, art, music,
culture then come along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free and open software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="when"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday's from beer O'clock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First event: Tuesday 20th October 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be there from 6pm Bermuda time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="where"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henry VII's pub and restaurant in Southampton Bermuda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there are four or less will probably just grab a table in the bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there are more I've been offered the room in the back of the sushi
restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="why"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let other's know what you are up to, share ideas, code, music, art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="who"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anybody and everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you are Henry, Henri, Enrique,
Kate, Kathryn or Katrina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henry:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Has gone back to Wales, but we can always work on a Henry
simulator, plus there are pleny of Henry pictures on the walls.
Might not be a wise idea.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things didn't work out too well for Henry's Kates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There might be hacking, but the only thing being executed will be
code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="agenda"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Agenda&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="should-we-execute-this-code"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Should we execute this code?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is for someone to present some code that has never been run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We discuss and debate whether it should be run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
@raspberrry pi @ fish&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="contributions"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Contributions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there are volunteers to present ideas, let me know and I will
advertise more widely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="visitors"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Visitors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are visiting the island do come along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to know how to get to Henry's, number 7 bus will get you
there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From town any number 7, just tell the driver you are going to Henry's
or Gibb's Hill Lighthouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to climb the lighthouse, note that it closes at 4pm, but
it is always a good place to watch the sunset from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bermuda Government, Department of Statistics has put out a Request
for Proposal (RFP) for a &lt;em&gt;web-based solution to support on-line
census&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are some thoughts on how Free Software could form the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The census raises many complex issues of privacy, accessibility and
access to information.  In short, is has all the features of a
typical software project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="free-software-solution"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Free Software Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most, if not all, of the pieces required to build this system already
exist as free software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This software is free in the sense that it gives you freedom.  Freedom
to examine the software, freedom to look how it works, freedom to
change it as you wish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freedom to pass the software on to others should you wish, so long as
you give them the same freedoms you received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A prototype can be built from these pieces in around 20 hours of
development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are Bermudians with the skills to do this and the time to devote
to such a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases they will be exploring new concepts, but that is the
nature of IT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many others they can call on to assist should they need
guidance, including the millions of people around the globe who
contribute to free software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="accessibility"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Accessibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accessibility is often neglected in software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many free software tools have good support for accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, a framework is provided to address a wide range of
accessibility issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone has different challenges working with computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hearing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;motor movements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;speech&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;language processing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reading&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;writing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the software itself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;citizens access to information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bermuda is an international island.  English is the dominant
language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documents are generally produced in English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the island has many nationalities living here and also has
many Bermudians who have travelled and lived abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also distinct communities within Bermuda with their own
language, culture and history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, of course, Bermuda is a popular travel destination, with many
nationalities paying visits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet there is very poor support for languages other than English on
most Bermuda related websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A free software solution would accommodate translations.  Further, it
would allow anyone to contribute to those translations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free software: means you can adapt for differing needs, since you have
the code.  Without the code you are tied to a third party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further others can help you.  A free software census solution for
Bermuda may be usable in many other juristictions.  Bermudians who
develop such software would be able to work with others wherever in
the world they may be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="public-access-to-information"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Public Access To Information&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Census data is invaluable in many ways.  It provides data that can
guide public policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TODO: Anology: vaccination: having your children vaccinated protects
them against illness, but also reduces the chance of epidemics
breaking out.  There are small risks to every vaccination, but the
benefits to society can be significant.  For example, consider the
elimination of polio, a disease that affect large numbers of people in
the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the UK there have been censuses since 1831 (may have been earlier).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collecting the data back in that day was a huge task.  At the time it
gave vast amounts of information about poplulation sizes, household
sizes and the age profile of the population and their occupations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the data was hand written.  Pages of data might have totals and
there were presumably clerks creating aggregate statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, genealogists find the census data both fascinating and
invaluable as they trace family history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK has been digitising this data over the last few years and
making it available on line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A free software solution to the census would anticipate PATI requests
by building access to information into the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than wait for PATI requests and have to then examine data to
see what should be released, the decisions about what should be
released, when and to who will be made up front and built into the
solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A system can be built that will only release certain information after
some specified period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some data may need reviewing after some number of years and released
or re-sealed based on that review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="transparency-and-privacy"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Transparency and Privacy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is assumed that aggregate data from the census will be made freely
available to citizens.  Our solution will include support for such
access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is recommended that any data of a sensitive nature be treated
appropriately, including the physical security of any computers
storing the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One possibility is to try to build a system that only stores
aggregrate information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should also be noted that in a small community like Bermuda
aggregate data, especially when combined with other similar data can
remove annonynimity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One recommendation would be to encourage community discussion about
the census questions and have the community guide the decisions
regarding privacy and access to information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collecting more personal data that will be stored in some sort of time
capsule for the benefit of future historians and genealogy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="computer-insecurity"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Computer insecurity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In view of all the high profile data breaches that the world has been
experiencing over recent months it should be apparent that storing
sensitive data on computers is not an easy task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our solution will recognise this fact and propose appropriate measures
for storing more sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it would be our recommendation to only collect data that the
residents of Bermuda are comfortable in sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="maintenance-and-development"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Maintenance and Development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a free software solution future maintenance and development of
the software can be performed by anyone with the skills.  The local
poplulation will have all the tools they need, they just need to learn
the skills needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, a well designed free software census would be usable in other
jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If developed here in Bermuda by Bermudians it would create
opportunities for the team to work elsewhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Free Software Centre&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="ownership-of-code"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ownership of code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government, not the developers would own and code developed for
the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be noted most of the code already exists and is free
software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is suggested that any code written for the project be itself
released as a free software project using the GPL license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="appendix-project-jupyter"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Appendix:  Project Jupyter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans in different parts of the world speak different languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans have also developed many different languages for communicating
with computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning these languages can take considerable time and effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most of the history of modern computing, communicating with other
languages has been difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In effect, the plethora of languages has worked to Balkanise the IT
world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://jupyter.org/"&gt;Project Jupyter&lt;/a&gt; is just one project that is helping languages work
together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jupyter is a tool that supports virtually seamless interoperability
between 50 different languages, from python, to perl, C++ to C#, Bash
to Brainfuck, erlang to lua, matlab to php.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="choosing-tools"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Choosing tools&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers invariably like to use the tools they know best.  They
understand them, know what they are capable of and know many of the
risks they will encounter using those tools to solve a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting a project with a new tool presents many additional risks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;will it work as advertised?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much time will it take to learn?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an organisation starting out in the free software world the choice
can be daunting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, any large organisation will likely end up using many
different languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst there are inefficiencies in this approach, there are
advantages, just as with growing crops: monoculture leaves an
organisation vulnerable to anything which threatens that ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Variety gives resilience, but at some cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Projects such as Jupyter help support that variety and reduce the
costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a particular technology choice is proving hard to support, porting
to another Jupyter supported language is always an option.&lt;/p&gt;

Parliament debate via the Hansard site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was actually unable to find a stream for the debates.  Further
enquiries revealed it does exist, but the streaming uses Microsoft's
Silverlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates a problem, since Microsoft has abandoned Silverlight and
it is no longer supported and does not work in many modern browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a scenario that gets repeated over and over.  In what follows,
I will be using government as an example, but you could substitute
&lt;em&gt;organisation&lt;/em&gt; for government and the story is the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here is a typical scenario:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Government has a problem to solve, in this case streaming recordings
of parliamentary debates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Government hires a consultant &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="http://openbermuda.github.io/80days/posts/future-proof-your-organisation-with-free-software.html#id2" id="id1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;  to implement a solution:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the consultant chooses the technology stack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;government workers lack time, resources and skills to understand the
choices the consultant is making.  This problem is exacerbated by
outsourcing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Consultant provides a solution with proprietary technologies.  In many
cases the consultant, not the government owns the software created for
the project.  The result is the government is locked into that
consultant for support and dependent on proprietary software
companies for support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proprietary vendor drops support for the tech that was used.  Result
is unmaintainable websites that eventually have to be replaced.
Everything is thrown out and the process is repeated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the free software world you get a different story:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Government has a problem to solve, in this case streaming recordings
of parliamentary debates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Government IT staff research free software solutions that will solve
the problem&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they look to see what others are using;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they work with those in other government departments with similar
problems;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they pick some free software projects that solve the problem and
that appear to be active and vibrant projects;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the solution is implemented;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;any software written is released as a free software project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, the end result is something that can be supported not
just by the government workers involved in the project, but actually
anyone with access to the code, which is in fact &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This includes enthusiasts in the local community, but also people
worldwide that are working with the technology that is being used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of being tied to a single supplier, there is choice and hence a
competitive market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software will generally be both free as in freedom and free as in
cost.  The money saved can be invested in developing local talent to
support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further money will be saved in the future due to not having to replace
the system due to proprietary vendors stopping support.  Sure the system
will need maintenance and future development, but the government workers
will have all the tools they need to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system will likely require lower cost hardware resource too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="silverlight-and-moonlight"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Silverlight and Moonlight&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Silverlight story is an excellent example of this sort of problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft launched Silverlight with a great fanfare, whilst ignoring
web standards such as HTML5 that provided very similar capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It integrated nicely with their .NET platform and they provided some
good tools to help with development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Silverlight failed to gain traction and by 2013 Microsoft
announced they were discontinuing development, just six years after
introducing the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="security-and-proprietary-frameworks"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Security and proprietary frameworks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This never ending stream of proprietary technologies, each supposedly
better than the previous technology, that is no longer supported,
creates serious computer security issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many government websites here in Bermuda use Adobe Flash or
Silverlight.  The latter is no longer supported, the former has very
patchy support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, government sites using Flash depend on ancient versions
that are likely riddled with security holes, yet impossible to
support.  Further, they simply do not work in modern browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free software greatly reduces this problem: since the software comes
with freedom, those using it have everything they need to support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upgrades are done only as and when significant improvements are made,
not on some corporation's timetable, designed to generate revenue for
that corporation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="mono"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mono&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silverlight is built on top of Microsoft's .NET framework.  .NET is
interesting technology, but in many ways not fundamentally different to
Java.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The free software community has always been wary of .NET.  There is a
project called "mono" that is a free implementation of .NET.  There were
concerns that mono infringes some Microsoft, might use those patents to
attack mono.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, this has not happened and recently Microsoft has released a
number of .NET related tools as open source, but there is still some
wariness about mono.  I believe it does have a significant role to play
in helping Microsoft shops migrate to free software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Silverlight was announced the Mono team started the Moonlight
project, a free implementation of silverlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project was abandonned in 2012 after poor adoption of Silverlight
and very few sites that use Silverlight work under Moonlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is that people who used Silverlight are left with an
expensive mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also interesting to read the criticisms of Silverlight in the
wikipedia article.  Note that many of these criticisms come from
companies like Adobe, who were probably more motivated by protecting
their ancient Flash technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Footnotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table class="docutils footnote" frame="void" id="id2" rules="none"&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col class="label"&gt;&lt;col&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;tbody valign="top"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="label"&gt;&lt;a class="fn-backref" href="http://openbermuda.github.io/80days/posts/future-proof-your-organisation-with-free-software.html#id1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;I say &lt;em&gt;consultant&lt;/em&gt; but it could be any vendor offering a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't mean to bash consultants, there are some excellent ones out
there, I am planning to be one myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consultant's work pattern should be to come to an organisation,
empower them to solve their own problem and leave them with all the
resources they need to continue to maintain and develop that
solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, "get in, solve the problem, empower the organisation, get
out".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;Too often the "empower the organisation" bit is skipped since by
not doing that the consultant creates future opportunities for
themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
