<p>On Friday I got to the point that the angular seed app is now checked
into my 80days repository.</p>
<p>Today's mission is to start turning that into the app I really want.</p>
<p>One of the first things I want to do is fix up angular so that it uses
different markers for its template substitution.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> uses '{{' and '}}' to mark blocks that the template engine
needs to pay attention to and do substitutions.  Actually, the <cite>django
template languate</cite> has two escape patterns:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>{{ and }} are used to mark variables to be expanded</li>
<li>{% and %} are used to mark django template tags.  These get used for
things like marking <em>for</em> loops and the like</li>
</ul>
<p>Now by an unhappy coincidence, <a class="reference external" href="https://angularjs.org/">angular.js</a> also uses {{ and }} to
mark stuff for expansion.</p>
<p>Happily, angular allows you to over-ride these markers, as follows:</p>
<pre class="code javascript"><a name="rest_code_3c075fe9458a4925b28c22c62d33548c-1"></a><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">my_app</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">angular</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">module</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'MyApp'</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">config</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">$interpolateProvider</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
<a name="rest_code_3c075fe9458a4925b28c22c62d33548c-2"></a>    <span class="nx">$interpolateProvider</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">startSymbol</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'{$'</span><span class="p">);</span>

<a name="rest_code_3c075fe9458a4925b28c22c62d33548c-4"></a><span class="p">});</span>
</pre>
<p>In fact, since I already had some code in my <em>app.js</em> I just added the
extra config code, so my <em>app.js</em> now looks like this:</p>

</pre>
<p>So, making some progress, but I still can't figure out this controller
thing and how to tie it all together.  Time to go back to
<a class="reference external" href="http://campus.codeschool.com">codeschool</a>.</p>
<p>In particular, their <a class="reference external" href="http://campus.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angular-js">shaping up with angular</a> introduction.  I had
to register with codeschool.  Thankfully, that was painless bar having
to create yet-another-password.</p>
<p>But it has been worth it.  You can watch the videos at 1.5x or 2.0x or
slow them down.  It would be great if they took the mythtv trick and
shifted the frequency of voices down so that the presenters don't
sound like chipmunks on speed when you speed things up.</p>
<p>The good bit is you can click on "Start Challenges" as soon as you are
bored with the video.</p>
<p>Once in the challenges, the "check my work" button is genius and
extraordinarily helpful.</p>
<div class="section" id="angular-date-filter">
<h2>Angular date filter</h2>
<p>I just fell in love with the angular date filter.  Feed it a unix
datetime and it does the right thing.  Eg Unix time began 1969/12/31 @
8:00PM in Bermuda, note the four our offset from UTC.</p>
<p>See this <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/swfiua/80days/commit/04a9b8a64f9cb402c434ad1f6b6224757ca09182">github commit</a> for some code.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="thanks">
<h2>Thanks</h2>
<p>Thanks to @ergoemacs on twitter who posted a link to their excellent
mini tutorial on <a class="reference external" href="http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_magit-mode_tutorial.html">magit-mode</a>: git mode for emacs.  I had this
installed already, but never quite plucked up the courage to try it.
Wow: git in emacs: lovely jubbly!</p>

<p>Those who know me probably think that Bill Gates is not exactly on my
top ten list of people I would like to meet.</p>
<p>I've been an free and open software enthusiast for longer than I care
to remember.  Let's just say that over the years Bill hasn't exactly
been a friend of open source.  To be fair, it pretty much threatened
to destroy his rather lucrative business model.</p>
<p>To some extent it has.  Bill has moved on, so has Steve "linux is a
cancer" Balmer.  Microsoft is making more and more code available as
open source.  I would guess they have realised that if you want to be
relevant in today's software world you need your stuff to run on
linux, or at least play nicely with that platform.</p>
<p>There is a lot going on in the tech world, it isn't clear how it is
all going to pan out.  But free and open source is stronger than
ever.</p>
<p>Last night, my <a class="reference external" href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Acegirl">ace-girl</a> and I wandered down the hill to the local
hostelry.</p>
<p>As I <a class="reference external" href="http://swfiua.github.io/80days/posts/the-music-from-uncle.html">blogged</a> a few weeks back, Saturday there is a DJ at this place
and it is often a fun night.  We were planning to meet another friend
who had just got back to the island.</p>
<p>We arrived and things were still quiet.  They were showing some
highlights from the FA Cup on the TV.  I love the FA Cup, always have
done.  It is when the lower league teams get a chance to show what
they can do against higher clubs.  Yesterday was a great day for the
underdogs.  Bradford City, also known as the <em>Bantams</em> (curiously,
google in their soccer info used the name <em>Bantams</em> rather than
Bradford City.  It was odd, because every other club was listed by
their more formal name.  It was Sheffield United, not the Blades
playing a Preston.</p>
<p>There were quite a few people having dinner at the place and 2-3 were
celebrating birthdays.  DJ Uncle was doing his round of the room,
figuring out his audience.</p>
<p>Around this time a guy walked by wearing a t-shirt and a silver tie,
all sparkles and glitter, obviously top quality as it was ready-tied
and held around his neck by a piece of elastic.   I saw the words,
"Bill's Gates" on his t-shirt.   My curiousity was peaked and we got
talking.</p>
<p>It soon became clear it was the guy's birthday.  He introduced himself
as Bill Gates (or it might have been Bill's Gates).  There may have
been some alcohol involved, so details are a little blurry.  But the
gist was he was founder member of "BFBC".  The F is along the same
lines as the f in swfiua.  So it was "Bill's F* Boat Club".</p>
<p>Clearly, this was my chance to be photographed with the man himself:</p>
<img alt="../galleries/Gates/Me%20with%20Bill's%20Gates.jpg" src="../galleries/Gates/Me%20with%20Bill's%20Gates.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 400px;">
<p>I can report that Bill was a fine upstanding character and was even
kind enough to give me one of his t-shirts:</p>
<img alt="../galleries/Gates/i_got_the_t_shirt.jpg" src="../galleries/Gates/i_got_the_t_shirt.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 400px;">
<p>Now in case you haven't heard Bermuda has been chosen as the venue for
the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.americascup.com/en/news/131_Bermuda-is-the-home-of-the-2017-America-s-Cup.html">2017 America's Cup</a>.  There is quite a bit of excitement about
the island due to this.  Maybe BFBC will enter the race :)</p>
<p>Of course, Uncle played <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inS9gAgSENE">Happy Birthday</a> for Bill and the others with
birthdays.</p>
<p>I have been on a bit of a Springsteen kick that last week or so,
something to do with starting to learn some tunes from my "Bruce
Springsteen easy guitar":</p>
<img alt="../galleries/Springsteen/Springsteen.jpg" src="../galleries/Springsteen/Springsteen.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 400px;">
<p>Ace girl asked Uncle if he would play some.  And in light of the giant
killings in the FA Cup and with the hope of more to come from the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield_United_F.C.">Red
and White Wizards</a> it was appropriate that he should choose <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vQpW9XRiyM">Glory Days</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks Bill and everyone who helped make last night a fun time.</p>
