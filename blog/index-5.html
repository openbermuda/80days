<div class="section" id="hill-climbing">
<h2>Hill Climbing</h2>
<p>I grew up close to the hills of the Peak District in Derbyshire.</p>
<p>The highest point of the Peak District is the summit of Kinder Scout.
This is also the first hill along the Pennine Way.</p>
<p>Most times I have climbed it via Grindsbrook.  It is steep in places
and follows alongside a small river and stream.  This used to be the
Pennine Way route, but now the official route takes you up the
gentler, but no less strenuous, Jacob's Ladder.</p>
<p>I am not even sure if I have ever made it to the highest point on
Kinder Scout.  The summit is more of a plateau, a strange landscape of
tiny streams running along little valleys cut into the peat the covers
the summit.</p>
<p>Most times I have been there it has been covered in cloud, navigating
with the help of a compass.</p>
<p>But on a clear day you can walk to the spectacular Kinder Downfall and
see all the way to Manchester and even beyond to the mountains of
Snowdonia.</p>
<p>In the UK, hills become mountains if they are 3000 feet or higher.
Snowdonia has mountains, the Peak District has hills.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="false-summits">
<h2>False summits</h2>
<p>Some hills I have climbed tease you with false summits.   You think
you are nearing the top, and then as you clamber over rocks, behind
what you thought was the summit, the route continues, onward and
upward.  Some hills have many false summits, each more enticing than
the last.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="summits">
<h2>Summits</h2>
<p>Reaching a summit is always a highlight.  Stood on the highest point
in the area and, weather permitting there will be uninterrupted views
all around.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="following-a-ridge">
<h2>Following a Ridge</h2>
<p>Having toiled to climb a hill you will rightly be satisfied with the
view you have.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when you look across the land there is a spectactular
hill, dwarfing the one you have just climbed.  You can only imagine
how the view might look from there.</p>
<p>Often the new summit is easily accessible from where you are, by
following a ridge that connects to the peak you have just climbed.  A
small descent and a longer climb may be all that is needed to reach a
new high-point.</p>
<p>The ridge acts like a natural bridge between two summits.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bridging-the-valley">
<h2>Bridging the valley</h2>
<p>Sometimes there is no such bridge.  Curiosity might drive you to
attempt the larger peak in the distance, but descending into the
valley after all that hard work climbing, just to climb another hill,
can be a daunting task.</p>
<p>There may be a river in the valley bottom, difficult to cross and
requiring a detour.</p>
<p>Bridges across valleys connect those either side.  They can be
difficult to build.  Without people either side willing to work
together it may not be possible to cross the divide.</p>
<p>Crossing a new bridge requires courage too.  There are rope walkways
across plunging gorges that I for one do not have the courage to
cross, let alone be the first to try out.</p>
<p>The first across are generally the bridge builders, often crossing
before the bridge is complete, fixing it along the way.</p>
<p>The Millennium Bridge across the Thames in London.  When people
started to walk across the bridge, the rhythm of their steps caused it
to resonate and wobble.  It was closed for months for modifications.</p>
<p>Soldiers always break out of step when marching across a bridge, for a
similar reason.</p>
<p>Those who build bridges have courage and vision, leading the way to a
new mountain with a more spectacular view, or uniting communities
previously separated by a plunging ravine.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="going-the-long-way-round">
<h2>Going the long way round</h2>
<p>Often there is no bridge, the valley may be too wide or deep, or just
not enough people wanting to cross to justify a high-level crossing.</p>
<p>Then you can rest at the summit, admire the view and be content with
your achievements.</p>
<p>But you may be intrigued by the mountain you have seen.</p>
<p>Descending into the valley you may get that sinking feeling, as you
lose all that height that took so much work to gain.</p>
<p>The valley bottom may have a bubbling river where you can drink,
perhaps catch a fish and regroup for the climb ahead.</p>
<p>Once, refreshed the long climb starts.  As you climb you can gauge
progress by looking across to the hill on which you once stood.</p>
<p>At some point you will draw level with the summit and once again be
able to see the view beyond the hill.</p>
<p>You may be daunted, recalling how much taller this mountain is, how
much more you have to climb.</p>
<p>But every step takes you higher than you were before.</p>

<p>Growing up as children we would watch The Magic Roundabout on the BBC.</p>
<p>It was a five minute children's program with a carousel, Zebedee,
Dougal the dog and Dylan the rabbit.</p>
<p>Each episode ended with Zebedee saying, "Time for bed", before
springing off, literally.</p>
<p>As we got older we might watch a bit of the news that followed.</p>
<div class="section" id="roundabouts-around-the-world">
<h2>Roundabouts around the world</h2>
<p>Around the world, traffic rules vary quite a bit.  Here are some
examples.</p>
<div class="section" id="france">
<h3>France</h3>
<p>In France roundabouts used to be much less common than in the UK.</p>
<p>The early traffic rule was essentially, "priorite a la droite".  This
rule dated back to horses and carriages and mostly they could see each
other coming for a good way, it was simple to slow down and give way
to those from one side.</p>
<p>Another key rule, is which side of the road to drive on.  The French,
like most of continental Europe, drive on the right.</p>
<p>Looked at from above, the French go anti-clockwise around
roundabouts.</p>
<p>So, when they arrive at one, those already on the roundabout give way
to new arrivals, coming from the right.</p>
<p>This works well with light traffic.  With heavy draffic, things can
fall apart: once the roundabout is full of cars nobody can go
anywhere, although if you are just taking the first right then you'll
probably be ok.</p>
<div class="section" id="arc-de-triomphe">
<h4>Arc de Triomphe</h4>
<p>Now this is more like The Magic Roundabout.  I have no idea what the
rules are.   Rumour has it that insurance companies exclude any
accident that happens here.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="british-isles">
<h3>British Isles</h3>
<p>Here they drive on the left and go clockwise round roundabouts.</p>
<p>You give way to those already on the roundabout.  Those already on can
keep going, those arriving have to wait for it to be safe to enter.</p>
<p>So, like the French you are giving way to those on the right.</p>
<p>Again, it can work well it depends on the traffic volume and pattern.</p>
<div class="section" id="swindon">
<h4>Swindon</h4>
<p>Swindon actually has a Magic Roundabout.</p>
<p>It is a crazy construction of five roundabouts with another roundabout
inside them all.</p>
<p>UK rules apply, so once you get on the thing it is like a
roller-coaster, just go with the flow.</p>
<p>When the accidents happen, people are usually moving pretty slowly.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="north-america">
<h3>North America</h3>
<p>Roundabouts used to be far less common in North America.  Four-way
stops are the order of the day.</p>
<p>You arrive at the junction and stop.  If no-one else is there then you
can proceed, others arriving after you should give way.</p>
<p>Now this can lead to the <em>Canadian stand-off</em>.   You arrive at a
roundabout just as someone else arrives.  There then follows an
elaborate dance where you both just sit there waiting for the other to
go first, often accompanied by hand-gestures.   Dead-lock is not
uncommon.</p>
<div class="section" id="ottawa">
<h4>Ottawa</h4>
<p>There is a roundabout near the Experimental Farm that itself seems to
be a wonderful experiment in mixing British and French roundabout
rules.</p>
<p>Back in the day it was probably a four way stop, a simple cross-roads.</p>
<p>Let's pretend there is a north-south (NS) road crossing east-west (EW)
and the NS is the bigger road.</p>
<p>If you are travelling NS or SN, you can pretent your are French and
drive straight on to the roundabout.  Those coming from an EW
direction will give way to you.</p>
<p>If you are turning left, then you will have to give way to traffic
entering on the NS road.</p>
<p>Now if you arrive on the EW road you have to give way to traffic
already on the roundabout.</p>
<p>So this is a complicated mixture of giving way to the left or right
depending on where you are on the roundabout.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="going-backwards-round-the-magic-roundabout">
<h4>Going backwards round the magic roundabout</h4>
<p><strong>* please don't try this *</strong></p>
<p>Traffic arriving from east (or west) could do a Pierre Trudeau, behind
the Queen pirouette, turning 180 degrees to enter the roundabout
backwards.</p>
<p>In this way, the <em>give way to traffic on your right</em> rule ensures the
traffic that you need to giver way to is always coming from your right.</p>
<p>Once on the roundabout another pirouette should be done, having done
this, again give way to traffic entering from the North/South road,
which is again on your right.</p>
<p>This also ensures if you exit on this route you are facing the right
way.</p>
<p>If continuing around the roundabout, another pirouette should be
performed after passing the north/south road.  Hence, you will again
be going backwards on the magic roundabout.   With your right side to
the centre of the roundabout there is no need to give way.</p>
<p>When I was much younger my mother one night announced she felt a
little typsy.  As a curious child I asked what that was like.  She
said, "it is like I am going backwards on the magic roundabout".</p>
<p>Like I said, don't try this on the road.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="johnny-barnes">
<h3>Johnny Barnes</h3>
<p>In Hamilton, Bermuda there are several roundabouts.</p>
<p>But there is one special one.  It is known as The Johnny Barnes
roundabout and has its own magic.</p>
<p>It is indeed magic.  Every weekday, between 5am and 10am you will see
Johnny Barnes.  He has been waving to traffic and dispensing love
at the roundabout since retiring from the Bus company.  He is now in
his 90's.</p>
<p>Bermuda has its own road rules.  Mostly following the British.  But
the horn only really gets used to say <em>hi</em> to friends and cousins.</p>
<p>If you see a friend trying to get out of a small side road you might
well follow the "priorite a la droite" rule and wave for them to go
ahead of you, even though you have right of way.  The roads are
narrow, the speed limit is 20 mph and a little give and take makes it
a better place for everyone.</p>
<p>But if you are new to the island, watch out for vehicles stopping to let
people out of tiny driveways and side roads.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-about-the-geese">
<h2>What about the geese?</h2>
<p>Last week the Mighty Blades played Swindon.  Those brave fans that
made the journey down to Swindon went there knowing they would have to
negotiate the Magic Roundabout.</p>
<p>Being Blades fans, they were probably expecting the worst and a heavy
defeat.  I believe all the fans got through the roundabout unscathed.</p>
<p>As for the game, well the new manager, Nigel Adkins, played a
motivational video before the game.  Google "geese sufc" and you
should find it.</p>
<p>It explains how geese are able to travel 70% further by flying in a V
formation.  How one goose will lead and when tired drop back into the
formation and let another take the lead.d</p>
<p>If a goose is tiring and struggling, two other strong geese will drop
down to the ocean with the struggler and stay with it until it either
dies or makes a recovery.  They will then fly together to rejoin the
flock, or tag onto another flock following behind.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="magic-roundabouts-and-mother-geese">
<h2>Magic Roundabouts and Mother Geese</h2>
<p>When I was younger, my mum was my Magic Roundabout.  She would watch
the world circling around her and find ways to change the paths of
those that needed to be on a different path, or gently put together
those that would benefit from each other.</p>
<p>I now have another Magic Roundabout in my life.  Mum's are magic.</p>

<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Bermuda Government, Department of Statistics has put out a Request
for Proposal (RFP) for a <em>web-based solution to support on-line
census</em>.</p>
<p>Below are some thoughts on how Free Software could form the solution.</p>
<p>The census raises many complex issues of privacy, accessibility and
access to information.  In short, is has all the features of a
typical software project.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="free-software-solution">
<h2>Free Software Solution</h2>
<p>Most, if not all, of the pieces required to build this system already
exist as free software.</p>
<p>This software is free in the sense that it gives you freedom.  Freedom
to examine the software, freedom to look how it works, freedom to
change it as you wish.</p>
<p>Freedom to pass the software on to others should you wish, so long as
you give them the same freedoms you received.</p>
<p>A prototype can be built from these pieces in around 20 hours of
development.</p>
<p>There are Bermudians with the skills to do this and the time to devote
to such a project.</p>
<p>In some cases they will be exploring new concepts, but that is the
nature of IT.</p>
<p>There are many others they can call on to assist should they need
guidance, including the millions of people around the globe who
contribute to free software.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="accessibility">
<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<p>Accessibility is often neglected in software.</p>
<p>Many free software tools have good support for accessibility.</p>
<p>Generally, a framework is provided to address a wide range of
accessibility issues.</p>
<p>Everyone has different challenges working with computers.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>vision</li>
<li>hearing</li>
<li>motor movements</li>
<li>speech</li>
<li>language processing</li>
<li>reading</li>
<li>writing</li>
<li>fear</li>
<li>the software itself</li>
<li>citizens access to information</li>
</ul>
<p>Bermuda is an international island.  English is the dominant
language.</p>
<p>Documents are generally produced in English.</p>
<p>However, the island has many nationalities living here and also has
many Bermudians who have travelled and lived abroad.</p>
<p>There are also distinct communities within Bermuda with their own
language, culture and history.</p>
<p>And, of course, Bermuda is a popular travel destination, with many
nationalities paying visits.</p>
<p>Yet there is very poor support for languages other than English on
most Bermuda related websites.</p>
<p>A free software solution would accommodate translations.  Further, it
would allow anyone to contribute to those translations.</p>
<p>Free software: means you can adapt for differing needs, since you have
the code.  Without the code you are tied to a third party.</p>
<p>Further others can help you.  A free software census solution for
Bermuda may be usable in many other juristictions.  Bermudians who
develop such software would be able to work with others wherever in
the world they may be.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="public-access-to-information">
<h2>Public Access To Information</h2>
<p>Census data is invaluable in many ways.  It provides data that can
guide public policy.</p>
<p>TODO: Anology: vaccination: having your children vaccinated protects
them against illness, but also reduces the chance of epidemics
breaking out.  There are small risks to every vaccination, but the
benefits to society can be significant.  For example, consider the
elimination of polio, a disease that affect large numbers of people in
the past.</p>
<p>In the UK there have been censuses since 1831 (may have been earlier).</p>
<p>Collecting the data back in that day was a huge task.  At the time it
gave vast amounts of information about poplulation sizes, household
sizes and the age profile of the population and their occupations.</p>
<p>All the data was hand written.  Pages of data might have totals and
there were presumably clerks creating aggregate statistics.</p>
<p>Nowadays, genealogists find the census data both fascinating and
invaluable as they trace family history.</p>
<p>The UK has been digitising this data over the last few years and
making it available on line.</p>
<p>A free software solution to the census would anticipate PATI requests
by building access to information into the system.</p>
<p>Rather than wait for PATI requests and have to then examine data to
see what should be released, the decisions about what should be
released, when and to who will be made up front and built into the
solution.</p>
<p>A system can be built that will only release certain information after
some specified period.</p>
<p>Some data may need reviewing after some number of years and released
or re-sealed based on that review.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="transparency-and-privacy">
<h2>Transparency and Privacy</h2>
<p>It is assumed that aggregate data from the census will be made freely
available to citizens.  Our solution will include support for such
access.</p>
<p>It is recommended that any data of a sensitive nature be treated
appropriately, including the physical security of any computers
storing the data.</p>
<p>One possibility is to try to build a system that only stores
aggregrate information.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that in a small community like Bermuda
aggregate data, especially when combined with other similar data can
remove annonynimity.</p>
<p>One recommendation would be to encourage community discussion about
the census questions and have the community guide the decisions
regarding privacy and access to information.</p>
<p>Collecting more personal data that will be stored in some sort of time
capsule for the benefit of future historians and genealogy.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="computer-insecurity">
<h2>Computer insecurity</h2>
<p>In view of all the high profile data breaches that the world has been
experiencing over recent months it should be apparent that storing
sensitive data on computers is not an easy task.</p>
<p>Our solution will recognise this fact and propose appropriate measures
for storing more sensitive data.</p>
<p>However, it would be our recommendation to only collect data that the
residents of Bermuda are comfortable in sharing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="maintenance-and-development">
<h2>Maintenance and Development</h2>
<p>With a free software solution future maintenance and development of
the software can be performed by anyone with the skills.  The local
poplulation will have all the tools they need, they just need to learn
the skills needed.</p>
<p>Further, a well designed free software census would be usable in other
jurisdictions.</p>
<p>If developed here in Bermuda by Bermudians it would create
opportunities for the team to work elsewhere in the world.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="free-software-centre">
<h2>Free Software Centre</h2>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ownership-of-code">
<h2>Ownership of code</h2>
<p>The government, not the developers would own and code developed for
the site.</p>
<p>It should be noted most of the code already exists and is free

<h2>Appendix:  Project Jupyter</h2>
<p>Humans in different parts of the world speak different languages.</p>
<p>Humans have also developed many different languages for communicating
with computers.</p>
<p>Learning these languages can take considerable time and effort.</p>
<p>For most of the history of modern computing, communicating with other
languages has been difficult.</p>
<p>In effect, the plethora of languages has worked to Balkanise the IT
world.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://jupyter.org/">Project Jupyter</a> is just one project that is helping languages work
together.</p>
<p>Jupyter is a tool that supports virtually seamless interoperability
between 50 different languages, from python, to perl, C++ to C#, Bash
to Brainfuck, erlang to lua, matlab to php.</p>
<div class="section" id="choosing-tools">
<h3>Choosing tools</h3>
<p>Developers invariably like to use the tools they know best.  They
understand them, know what they are capable of and know many of the
risks they will encounter using those tools to solve a problem.</p>
<p>Starting a project with a new tool presents many additional risks:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>will it work as advertised?</li>
<li>How much time will it take to learn?</li>
</ul>
<p>For an organisation starting out in the free software world the choice
can be daunting.</p>
<p>Further, any large organisation will likely end up using many
different languages.</p>
<p>Whilst there are inefficiencies in this approach, there are
advantages, just as with growing crops: monoculture leaves an
organisation vulnerable to anything which threatens that ecosystem.</p>
<p>Variety gives resilience, but at some cost.</p>
<p>Projects such as Jupyter help support that variety and reduce the
costs.</p>
<p>If a particular technology choice is proving hard to support, porting
to another Jupyter supported language is always an option.</p>

<p>Fred formed way in the east of the Atlantic.  I believe it was already
a hurricane going over the Cape Verde islands.  I was shown pictures
today of seas damaging a pier.  I have not heard too much more about
damage.</p>
<p>Six years ago, Fred formed around the same area a little further
south, but did not intensify as fast.  It did become a hurricane, then
dissipated as it curled, for a short while was heading easterly, then
got pushed back westward.  By this time it had fallen apart and it
did not get organised again, but the remnants of the storm tracked a
good way across the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Looking at the discussion of Fred, it is likely to be pulled apart in
the short term.  Then the track forecasts give a range of
possibilities, including heading westward.</p>
<p>Latest (5AM AST, 1st September) forecast discussion:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCDAT1+shtml/010849.shtml">http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCDAT1+shtml/010849.shtml</a></p>
<p>These discussions tend to be very helpful in gauging how much
confidence the forecasters about the forecasts.</p>
<p>These days, both track and intensity forecasts can be pretty accurate
out to 24 hours or so.</p>
<p>This paragraph from the discussion has a lot of information in it:</p>
<blockquote>
Fred is expected to move between west-northwest and northwest for
the next 72 hours as a mid-level ridge to the north of the cyclone
gradually builds westward. After that time, a turn toward the
north-northwest and north is forecast due to a deep-layer trough
currently over eastern Canada that is expected to dig
southeastward over the central Atlantic and erode the ridge. The
NHC model guidance is in decent agreement on this developing
pattern change.  However, there are significant differences in the
model solutions with the HWRF, GFS, and GFDL models keeping Fred
stronger and making the northward turn sooner, whereas the weaker
solution models like the UKMET and ECMWF take a weaker and more
vertically shallow cyclone farther west before turning it
northward.  The official forecast track is a little south of the
previous advisory track, mainly due to the more southerly initial
position, and follows a blend of the weaker UKMET and ECMWF
solutions.</blockquote>
<p>At the end, we learn the current forecast track is further south than
the previous advisory.  The discussion notes this is mostly because
Fred did not move as far north as expected over the previous period.</p>
<p>Disagreements in models are usually informative, often indicating
there is more uncertainty in the forecast.  Sometimes the forecasters
have good understanding of why the models are disagreeing, different
models have different strengths.</p>
