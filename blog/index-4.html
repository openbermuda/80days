<p>The last few weeks the Atlantic hurricane season has got more active.</p>
<p>Danny never really got started, was blown apart by sheer, but no doubt
spawned a lot of thunderstorms.</p>
<p>Flooding from Erika has resulted in numerous deaths in Domincan
Republic.</p>
<p>Erika has fallen apart, but again there will be a lot of thunderstorms
along its path.  There is a lot of moisture in the atmosphere.</p>
<div class="section" id="erika">
<h2>Erika</h2>
<p>Early forecasts had the most likely track heading over Hispanola, Then
curving, but likely being blown apart by sheer from strong upper
atmosphere winds related to El Nino.</p>
<p>This is in fact very close to what actually has happened.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="track-forecast">
<h2>Track forecast</h2>
<p>The weather models started to suggest the storm would curve more
northerly.  This all involves really complex systems that stretch over
thousands of miles.</p>
<p>So the models most likely path was more northerly, and that might take
it on a path to hit Florida.</p>
<p>At one point the most likely track was heading all up the east coast
of Florida, without making landfall.  If it had held together it might
of intensified over hot water with low windsheer and been a major
storm at landfall in the Carolinas.</p>
<p>Throughout this period there was always the possibility of heading
over Hispanola, but it wasn't the most likely path.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="andrew">
<h2>Andrew</h2>
<p>Andrew formed in a similar season to 2015 with a high El Nino.</p>
<p>It took a more northerly track, steered north of the Caribbean, then
turned straight into Florida.</p>
<p>I think a comparison of Andrew and Erika, Danny too, would be
interesting.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fred">
<h2>Fred</h2>
<p>Hurricane names run on a six year cycle.  So, there are six lists,
that repeat every six years.</p>
<p>If a storm becomes significant in some way, usually the more intense
and damaging storms that hit land, the name gets <em>retired</em> from the
list and is forever associated with that storm.</p>
<p>So, we have Fred.  Now for me, Fred means Fiery Fred Trueman,
Yorkshire and England fast bolwer.  I never saw him play, but often
heard him commentating on test matches.</p>
<p>So some day we will see a Fiery Fred storm.</p>
<p>A storm named Fred has just formed.  Like Erika, there is a fair
amount of uncertainty on what path it takes and how intense it will
get.</p>

<p>The raspberry pi 2 comes with around 6 times the processing power of
the original pi.</p>
<p>It is still fairly low powered, but it is interesting to compare the
pi with some older computers that were considered powerful in their
day.</p>
<p>The pi comes with an ARM 7, quad-core processor.  It also has a
Broadcom graphics processor that can potentially be used for compute
intensive work.</p>
<p>It also comes with 1GB of memory.</p>
<p>For disk storage the nornal approach is to use a micro SD card.  There
are 16GB cards that give 45MB/s read/write capability.</p>
<p>For less than $1000 you can get 20 pi's, with fast SD cards.  The
result is a machine with 80 cores, 16GB of memory and 320GB of disk,
with a combined bandwidth of 900MB/s read and write.</p>
<p>These things are low power, so a 20 pi machine would require just 100
watts of power.</p>
<p>It is reasonable to assume that more powerful devices will be
available in he future.</p>
<p>In short, computing power is becoming very, very cheap.</p>
<div class="section" id="cray-xmp">
<h2>Cray-XMP</h2>
<p>To give some indication of how cheap compute power has become, this
<a class="reference external" href="http://vk5tu.livejournal.com/50955.html">comparison to a Cray-XMP</a> shows that the older Pi B+ has very
similar compute power to the Cray-XMP.</p>
<p>When you compate the inflation adjusted price tags you see how cheap
compute power has become.</p>
<p>The Pi 2 is roughly six times the power of the B+.  Hence 20 of those
gives you 120 Cray-XMP's.   For $1000.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="renewable-energy">
<h2>Renewable energy</h2>
<p>One criticism often directed at renewable energy is that sun, wind and
wave are not reliable.  In order to reliably meet peak demand much
it is necessary to have much more capacity than is needed on average.</p>
<p>One way to mitigate this cost is to have uses for the spare capacity.</p>
<p>One possible use is to have a compute farm to mop up spare capacity.
This works particularly well if you have long running computations
that can be used to mop up spare compute cycles.</p>
<p>Bitcoin mining is one potential application.</p>

<p>Last Saturday there was a big cricket match at Lord's.</p>
<p>Not the Lord's where England were falling apart as the Aussies were
dominating the second test, but Lord's in St David's, Bermuda.</p>
<p>Bailey's Bay were playing Cleveland County in what is known as the
Eastern Counties.</p>
<p>Each team in Bermuda has its colours, Bay are red and white, Cleveland
are blue and white.</p>
<p>I come from Sheffield, UK, a city divided between the blue and white
of the Owls and the red and white of the Mighty Blades.  I follow the
Blades, so it was natural for me to be cheering for Bailey's Bay.</p>
<p>We had a slow start to the day and it was a long (for Bermuda) ride on
the moped to St David's, so we didn't get to the ground until just
before lunch.</p>
<p>As we entered we were greeted by a larger than life character in red
and white.  Once I took out my red and white, <em>cat in the hat</em>
headgear he directed us towards the Digicel tent.</p>
<img alt="../galleries/EasternCounties/20150718_123538.jpg" src="../galleries/EasternCounties/20150718_123538.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;"><p>The game was nicely poised, with Cleveland batting first and on about
80 runs for 4 wickets at lunch.</p>
<p>After lunch the Bay bowlers dominated and Cleveland were bowled out
for 127 in 49.3 overs.</p>
<img alt="../galleries/EasternCounties/20150718_151601.jpg" src="../galleries/EasternCounties/20150718_151601.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;"><p>Lord's is a wonderful ground, right by the ocean, with natural banks
on which people build stands.  Between innings we went for a walk
round the ground and took some pictures.</p>
<img alt="../galleries/EasternCounties/20150718_125203.jpg" src="../galleries/EasternCounties/20150718_125203.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;"><p>And then there is the precariously perched commentary position that
you have to walk the plank to get to:</p>
<img alt="../galleries/EasternCounties/20150718_152446.jpg" src="../galleries/EasternCounties/20150718_152446.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;"><p>Now being a Blades supporter I have got used to my team snatching
defeat from the jaws of victory.  The target of 128 that Bay were set
should have been easily within their grasp, but we were about to
witness one of the most bizarre afternoon's cricket there ever was.</p>
<p>Bay lost two early wickets, but then regrouped and the batsmen were
starting to open up at 50-2.   Cleveland had a couple of strong
appeals turned down.  There was a strong appeal for a catch, but it
was one of those where it was hard to tell if the ball had been
blocked into the ground or hit the ground and come off the bat.  The
umpire gave the benefit of the doubt to the batsman.</p>
<p>Cleveland protested and for 40 minutes chaos ensued.  Both coaches,
the president of the Eastern Counties and even a policeman took to the
pitch to try and get the game restarted.</p>
<img alt="../galleries/EasternCounties/20150718_171958.jpg" src="../galleries/EasternCounties/20150718_171958.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;"><p>Soon after the restart, there was another delay for a drinks break.
The batsmen were finding it difficult to get into any sort of rhythm
and first ball after the break a wicket fell.</p>
<p>After this wickets fell steadily, but Bay always looked like they
would make it.  Until, after 30 overs, with the scores tied and Bay
with just 2 wickets remaining the umpires declared the game over.</p>
<p>With the scores tied, Cleveland, as holders, were declared winners.</p>
<p>It reminded me of the infamous F.A. Cup tie when the Blades were
holding their own against an Arsenal side.  The ball was kicked into
play for an injury.  The resulting throw was sportingly thrown back to
the blades players, but Kanu did not seem to understand what was
happening, raced onto the ball and slotted it into the net.</p>
<p>Arsenal went on to win, but Wenger graciously agreed to replay the
game.  Of course, the Blades went on to lose the replay, but at least
the game was not decided by this bizarre incident.</p>
<p>I read today that the Cleveland coach was very unhappy with his sides
behaviour, perhaps he will follow Wenger's example and ask for the
game to be replayed.  However, that might not be possible given the
busy summer cricket schedule here in Bermuda, with Cup Match <a class="footnote-reference" href="../posts/red-and-white-v-blue-and-white.html#id2" id="id1">[2]</a> less than
two weeks away this might not be an option.</p>
<p>Today's Royal Gazette has a full page <a class="reference external" href="http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20150720/COMMENT01/150729969">editorial</a> on the game.  There
are also rumours that Cleveland have been <a class="reference external" href="http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20150720/SPORT02/150729960">stripped of the cup</a>.</p>
<p>It is never dull following the Red and White wizards.</p>
<p>So much for the cricket, the day itself was fun from beginning to
end.  Unfortunately, I had packed the bag of stuff to take to the
ground, so instead of drinks and food and sunscreen we had an
assortment of raspberry pi's, humidity sensors, air pressure sensors,
wires, breadboards and a netbook.</p>
<p>There was food in the clubhouse, yellow and blue, St David's colours.
So we were able to find some chips that weren't made of silicon.  And
the rum swizzle went down very smoothly.</p>
<p>The banter in the crowd rarely stopped, with fans from both sides
sitting enjoying together.</p>
<p>Cricket in Bermuda is very much something you go to watch with family
and friends.  Worst case, you have a day in the sunshine in a
beautiful setting, with people you love.</p>
<p>Next stop the blue and red of Somerset playing the light and dark blue
of St George's.  Cup Match!</p>

</h2>
<p>July 18th is Nelson Mandela's birthday, he would have been 97.</p>
<p>The United Nations calls it Mandela Day, or international day for
freedom, justice and democracy.  They say:</p>
<p>Every year on 18 July — the day Nelson Mandela was born — the UN
   joins a call by the Nelson Mandela Foundation to devote 67 minutes of
   time to helping others, as a way to mark Nelson Mandela International
   Day.</p>
<p>For 67 years Nelson Mandela devoted his life to the service of
   humanity — as a human rights lawyer, a prisoner of conscience, an
   international peacemaker and the first democratically elected
   president of a free South Africa.</p>
<p>There is more here:  <a href="http://www.un.org/en/events/mandeladay/">http://www.un.org/en/events/mandeladay/</a></p>
<p>There are a number of events being organised in Bermuda.</p>

<p>Angles are measured in different units.  Mostly, people seem to use degrees.</p>
<p>A right angle is 90 degrees.  The angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.</p>
<p>In mathematics it is often useful to use different units, <em>radians</em>.</p>
<p>$\pi$ radians is equal to 180 degrees.  So the angles in a triangle
add up to 180 degrees.</p>
<p>Now just as there are 60 minutes in an hour, there are also 60 minutes in a degree.</p>
<p>So, 67 minutes of $\pi$ is just 67 minutes from 180 degrees.</p>

    <div>
<p>A few days ago I was hoping to be able to listen to a Bermuda
Parliament debate via the Hansard site.</p>
<p>I was actually unable to find a stream for the debates.  Further
enquiries revealed it does exist, but the streaming uses Microsoft's
Silverlight.</p>
<p>This creates a problem, since Microsoft has abandoned Silverlight and
it is no longer supported and does not work in many modern browsers.</p>
<p>This is a scenario that gets repeated over and over.  In what follows,
I will be using government as an example, but you could substitute
<em>organisation</em> for government and the story is the same.</p>
<p>So here is a typical scenario:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Government has a problem to solve, in this case streaming recordings
of parliamentary debates.</li>
<li>Government hires a consultant <a class="footnote-reference" href="../posts/future-proof-your-organisation-with-free-software.html#id2" id="id1">[1]</a>  to implement a solution:<ul>
<li>the consultant chooses the technology stack</li>
<li>government workers lack time, resources and skills to understand the
choices the consultant is making.  This problem is exacerbated by
outsourcing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Consultant provides a solution with proprietary technologies.  In many
cases the consultant, not the government owns the software created for
the project.  The result is the government is locked into that
consultant for support and dependent on proprietary software
companies for support.</li>
<li>Proprietary vendor drops support for the tech that was used.  Result
is unmaintainable websites that eventually have to be replaced.
Everything is thrown out and the process is repeated.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the free software world you get a different story:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Government has a problem to solve, in this case streaming recordings
of parliamentary debates.</li>
<li>Government IT staff research free software solutions that will solve
the problem<ul>
<li>they look to see what others are using;</li>
<li>they work with those in other government departments with similar
problems;</li>
<li>they pick some free software projects that solve the problem and
that appear to be active and vibrant projects;</li>
<li>the solution is implemented;</li>
<li>any software written is released as a free software project.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In this scenario, the end result is something that can be supported not
just by the government workers involved in the project, but actually
anyone with access to the code, which is in fact <em>everyone</em>.</p>
<p>This includes enthusiasts in the local community, but also people
worldwide that are working with the technology that is being used.</p>
<p>Instead of being tied to a single supplier, there is choice and hence a
competitive market.</p>
<p>The software will generally be both free as in freedom and free as in
cost.  The money saved can be invested in developing local talent to
support it.</p>
<p>Further money will be saved in the future due to not having to replace
the system due to proprietary vendors stopping support.  Sure the system
will need maintenance and future development, but the government workers
will have all the tools they need to do this.</p>
<p>The system will likely require lower cost hardware resource too.</p>
<div class="section" id="silverlight-and-moonlight">
<h2>Silverlight and Moonlight</h2>
<p>The Silverlight story is an excellent example of this sort of problem.</p>
<p>Microsoft launched Silverlight with a great fanfare, whilst ignoring
web standards such as HTML5 that provided very similar capabilities.</p>
<p>It integrated nicely with their .NET platform and they provided some
good tools to help with development.</p>
<p>However, Silverlight failed to gain traction and by 2013 Microsoft
announced they were discontinuing development, just six years after
introducing the technology.</p>
<div class="section" id="security-and-proprietary-frameworks">
<h3>Security and proprietary frameworks</h3>
<p>This never ending stream of proprietary technologies, each supposedly
better than the previous technology, that is no longer supported,
creates serious computer security issues.</p>
<p>Many government websites here in Bermuda use Adobe Flash or
Silverlight.  The latter is no longer supported, the former has very
patchy support.</p>
<p>In any case, government sites using Flash depend on ancient versions
that are likely riddled with security holes, yet impossible to
support.  Further, they simply do not work in modern browsers.</p>
<p>Free software greatly reduces this problem: since the software comes
with freedom, those using it have everything they need to support it.</p>
<p>Upgrades are done only as and when significant improvements are made,
not on some corporation's timetable, designed to generate revenue for
that corporation.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mono">
<h2>Mono</h2>
<p>Silverlight is built on top of Microsoft's .NET framework.  .NET is
interesting technology, but in many ways not fundamentally different to
Java.</p>
<p>The free software community has always been wary of .NET.  There is a
project called "mono" that is a free implementation of .NET.  There were
concerns that mono infringes some Microsoft, might use those patents to
attack mono.</p>
<p>In fact, this has not happened and recently Microsoft has released a
number of .NET related tools as open source, but there is still some
wariness about mono.  I believe it does have a significant role to play
in helping Microsoft shops migrate to free software.</p>
<p>When Silverlight was announced the Mono team started the Moonlight
project, a free implementation of silverlight.</p>
<p>The project was abandonned in 2012 after poor adoption of Silverlight
and very few sites that use Silverlight work under Moonlight.</p>
<p>The result is that people who used Silverlight are left with an
expensive mess.</p>
<p>It is also interesting to read the criticisms of Silverlight in the
wikipedia article.  Note that many of these criticisms come from
companies like Adobe, who were probably more motivated by protecting
their ancient Flash technology.</p>

<p>I don't mean to bash consultants, there are some excellent ones out
there, I am planning to be one myself.</p>
<p>Consultant's work pattern should be to come to an organisation,
empower them to solve their own problem and leave them with all the
resources they need to continue to maintain and develop that
solution.</p>
<p>In short, "get in, solve the problem, empower the organisation, get
out".</p>
<p class="last">Too often the "empower the organisation" bit is skipped since by
not doing that the consultant creates future opportunities for
themselves.</p>

<p>The week 10th to 18th October 2015 there is a lot happening in Bermuda.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>TEDx Bermuda on 10th October</p>

<li>
<p>America's Cup racing 16th-18th October</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first anniversary of hurricanes Fay and Gonzalo</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This creates a good opportunity to run a number of small events around
<a href="../posts/d-bermuda-pi.html">Free Software</a> and <a href="../posts/d-bermuda-pi.html">Free Culture</a>.</p>
<p>Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics <a href="../posts/d-bermuda-pi.html">STEM</a> is already
getting a lot of attention.  This is natural in a world where there is
so much innovation and change in current times.</p>
<p>Throughout my life technological change has created a lot of wonderful
things.  At the same time, humanity and social systems are struggling
to keep pace with this change.</p>
<p><a href="../posts/d-bermuda-pi.html">STEAM</a> adds the Arts into STEM.  Making the Bermuda $\pi$ a STEAM
powered event seems a natural choice, as the event can then embrace
Bermudian culture in general.</p>
<p>At the same time, a hurricane can be viewed as a giant steam engine.
Bermuda once ran a steam powered island.  How about bringing this to
the 21st century:  <em>D Bermuda $\pi$, STEAM powered</em>.</p>
<h5 id="Free-Culture">Free Culture<a class="anchor-link" href="../posts/d-bermuda-pi.html#Free-Culture">¶</a>
</h5>
<p>People in the free software movement have been dealing with this
change for some time.  They have developed ways of working with
technology that not only scale, but also enable people to build
systems that evolve naturally over time.</p>
<p>There is a more general Free Culture movement, publishing artistic
material under <a href="../posts/d-bermuda-pi.html">Creative Commons</a> licenses that mirror the free
software licenses.  Generally, these licenses allow others to build on
the ideas and use them in their own work, usually with attribution.
Some licenses do not permit commercial use, but many do.  Authors
choose a license based on their own values.</p>

<p>Any event during hurricane season has to pay attention to the weather.</p>
<p>Given that one theme of <code>D Bermuda Pi</code> will be hurricane research it
would be unfortunate if the event were hit by a hurricane.</p>
<p>Having said that, it would give the researchers valuable first hand experience.</p>
<p>One project to work on during the week would be getting better
estimates of the probability of the event being hit by bad weather.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use long term climate features such as El Nino, the North Atlantic
Oscillation, and the Bermuda High to help with contingency planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop tools that can help with future event planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Study detailed windfields around the island to better understand the
challenges faced by the sailors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Study tides and currents around the island</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../posts/d-bermuda-pi.html">Murphy's Law</a> is likely to intervene here, so in the meanwhile it
would be good if we kept an eye on the long range hurricane forecasts
and nearer the time be in a position to work with Bermuda Weather and
have plans in place in the event of bad weather.</p>

</h4>
<p>Paget Island is one of a number of Government run islands.  It has
basic facilities.  It would make an excellent venue for a coding
sprint focussing on the environment and sustainability.</p>
<p>Bermuda is an expensive place to visit, some free sofware enthusiasts
would be more than happy to come and camp on the island.</p>
<p>One goal would be to make this as inclusive an event as possible,
hence creating many different activities that will appeal to different
demographics, but also to find ways to mix those people and give them
new experiences.</p>
<p>The buildings and infrastructure on Paget Island are in need of some
TLC.  It would be good to work towards building a place run on
renewable energy, environmentally positive where people can come to
study how we are doing things in Bermuda.</p>
<p>The philosophy of a camp on the island would be to leave the place
better than it is found.</p>

</h4>
<p>This blog started as a blog for an idea to create an <em>Around the world
in 80 days</em> idea, to run little competitions where people get miles
(or kilometers) for activities.  The idea is to see how far round the
world you can get in 80 days, with fun twists along the way.
One idea was to do an <em>Around Bermuda on Bermuda Bus and Ferry</em>
competition.  I learnt a lot on the project, but never quite got it
out of the door.  But that is another story.</p>
<p>There is a version still limping along on heroku: <a href="https://tonzone80days.herokuapp.com/">https://tonzone80days.herokuapp.com/</a></p>
<p>Kudos to heroku.  I have a half build project running there, haven't
checked it in ages and boom it springs into life.</p>
<p>There are some other pieces coming together that might make the bus
thing viable in the near future, just needs a bit of time applied to
it.</p>
<p>One thing that I found useful in the project was thinking in an 80 day
time horizon.  So I was curious about what date is 80 days before 10th
October 2015, the date for the start of the Bermuda $\pi$.</p>
<p>Hitting <em>Home</em> on the <a href="https://tonzone80days.herokuapp.com/">https://tonzone80days.herokuapp.com/</a> shows me this:</p>
<p>Jun 29, 2015 is today's date</p>
<p>Sep 17, 2015 is 80 days from today</p>
<p>Apr 10, 2015 was 80 days ago</p>
<p>So time for a little python.</p>

<p>There is a wonderful equation in mathematics that links some of the key

<p>There is $\pi$, the ratio between a circle's diameter and its

<p>Then there is <em>e</em>.</p>
<p>Both $\pi$ and $e$ are transcendental, a special type of number,

they turn up in mathematics they tend to be important.</p>
<p>Then there is 1.  The special number that you can multiply any other

<p>This year's TLF students are considering creating an application to
give Bermuda's public transport users up to date information on where
the buses and ferries actually are.</p>
<p>Transit authorities that have made this data available have found a
number of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.actsoft.com/public-transportation-profits-from-gps-tracking/">benefits</a> of bus tracking, including increased usage of
public transport.</p>
<p>There is a thriving open source project, <a class="reference external" href="http://onebusaway.org/">One Bus Away</a> which looks
like it could be used in the Bermuda environment.</p>
<p>A first step in getting the transport data into the <a class="reference external" href="https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference">General Transit
Feed Specification</a> (GTFS) format.  This provides a flexible format
for transit data.  It is how you specify bus stop locations, routes
and timetables.  Once you have your data in this format there are a
number of projects that you can use to create a powerful transit
application.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://onebusaway.org/">One Bus Away</a> project is an open source project that is being
used in a number of US and Canadian cities.  It should be usable here
in Bermuda too.</p>
<p>Google provides good support for transit information and the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2015/06/the-netherlands-debuts-new-google-public-transport-service/">Netherlands</a> recently became the first country in the world to
provide full information via their service.</p>
<p>Whilst this support from Google is good to have, since many tourists
will be using google maps whilst visiting the island, there are
benefits to being in control of your own data and websites.  There are
restrictions on the use of Google maps and you are not in control of
future development when you use that platform.  Further, users may not
wish to share their location with Google due to privacy concerns.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=bermuda#map=12/32.2949/-64.7830">OpenStreetMap</a> is an free and open project to make top quality
digital maps available.  The Bermuda map is quite excellent.  Further,
there is a good open source javascript library, <a class="reference external" href="http://leafletjs.com/">leaflet</a> to create
interactive maps using OpenStreetMap data.</p>
<p>A few months back Open Bermuda started work on a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/openbermuda/wheres-de-bus">Where's de bus</a>
project during a hackathon.  The challenge at that time was finding
out where the actual bus stops were.  It is hoped that it will be
possible to get this information and full bus and ferry timetables in
machine readable form from the Bermuda Transportation Board (BTB).</p>
<p>Given the small size of Bermuda and its transit network it would also
be possible to crowd-source the data for a transit application.  If
live GPS data is not avaialable from BTB an alternative would be to
create a mobile application that public transport users could run and
use to report bus locations as well as how full the bus currently is.</p>
<p>There are already some open source GPS tracking systems available such
as <a class="reference external" href="http://www.opengts.org/">OpenGTS</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.traccar.org/">Traccar</a> that might be usable here.</p>

<p>If you visit Bermuda you will likely end up at Horseshoe Bay at some
point during your trip.</p>
<p>This is one of the biggest and busiest of the South Shore beaches.
Whenever there is a long weekend things will be happening on Horseshoe
Bay, such as the annual Good Friday flying of kites.</p>
<p>From Horseshoe Bay you can walk along the coast, past a number of
smaller and quieter beaches and coves.  Often you will be able to find
a beach to yourself, with pink sands, turquoise water and tropical
fish swimming around the reefs.</p>
<p>At the top of the driveway that leads down to Horseshoe Bay you will
find Southampton Rangers football and cricket club.  On the weekend
you might be able to watch some cricket and get some refreshment.</p>
<p>There is also a restaurant, Gulf Stream where you can get a bite to
eat.</p>
<p>Less than a couple of hundred yards to the west you will find a small
side-road, Turtle Place.  This is where local artist Sharon Wilson
lives.  Her home is also her studio and her gallery.</p>
<p>If she is open for visitors she usually puts out a <em>sandwich board</em> at
the end of the road, sometimes with a couple of balloons attached.  In
that case, you are in luck.  She will welcome you to her home and let
you discover her art.</p>
<p>I have a copy of a book she produced, here is the cover:</p>
<img alt="../galleries/SharonWilson/book_cover.jpg" src="../galleries/SharonWilson/book_cover.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 400px;"><p>My cat seems to like the book too:</p>
<img alt="../galleries/Snowy/snowy_wilson.jpg" src="../galleries/Snowy/snowy_wilson.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 400px;"><p>There is a story behind everything she paints.  She will tell you some
of those stories, but also let you find your own story.</p>
<p>Here is another picture, it has a good story too:</p>

<p>I am writing this as I fly back to Bermuda from another wonderful
PyCon.  This year it was again in Montreal, the same venue as last
year.  The next two years it will be in Portland, Oregon.</p>
<p>This is just one of the wonders of PyCon, the opportunity to visit
vibrant cities with large tech communities.</p>
<p>The conference was bigger than ever, 3000 attendees.  My first PyCon
was a mere 400 or so attendees.  Happily, as the conference has grown
in size, it has retained the spirit that makes it a fantastic
experience for old and new pythonistas.  If anything, it is more
welcoming and inclusive as the years pass.  The community actively
seeks to be inclusive and there were a number of talks and events
along this theme.</p>
<p>The community spirit is absolutely fundamental to the success of
python.  It is one of the main reasons to consider the language.  When
you are working with python there is a huge community of enthusiastic
and dedicated people who are only too happy to share their work and
help others.</p>
<p>Below are some of the personal highlights from the conference, but
there really is so much going on that what you will read here is just
a snapshot of the magic that is PyCon and the python community.</p>
<p>It is also in no particular order.</p>
<div class="section" id="satellite-data-for-everyone">
<h2>Satellite data for everyone</h2>
<p>Chris Waigl gave an excellent talk on satellite imagery, the freely
available data, how to work with it and the python tools that enable
that work.</p>
<p>Seeing what others are able to do with data like this inevitably
inspires new ideas.</p>
<p>I am planning to take a look at what imagery is available for Bermuda
over the period of the hurricanes Fay and Gonzalo that hit the island
separated only by six days.</p>
<p>There will definitely be good before and after imagery, with luck
there will also be some usable images from the six day period between
the storms.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-usual-suspects">
<h2>The usual suspects</h2>
<p>The python community has some speakers that are very skilled at
presenting complex ideas in an entertaining and informative way.
They are always worth looking out for.  If you are new at PyCon, ask
others what talks they are going to, it will help you be in the right
room for you.</p>
<p>Oh, and don't panic, pretty much all talks are recorded and available
online (youtube seems to have replaced PyVideo here).</p>
<p>This year, for me, it was the three B's: Beazely, Bernhart and
Batchelder.</p>
<div class="section" id="david-beazely-live-coding">
<h3>David Beazely live coding</h3>
<p>I always enjoy listening to David Beazely.  This year he spoke on
python concurrency with live coding.  I am guessing there were at
least 1000 people present.  For added kicks and giggles he chose
python 3.5.0a3 (I think).  The key bit was the 'a', he was doing a
live demo with an alpha version of python: what could possibly go
wrong?  He demonstrated the way the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)
impacts performance of threaded code.</p>
<p>One line that grabbed my attention was that the GIL does not behave
like an operating system.  The GIL is all about making sure threads
don't trample on each other by mangling shared data.  In short, within
python only one thread can run at a time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ned-batchelder-names-and-values">
<h3>Ned Batchelder names and values</h3>
<p>Ned Batchelder spoke on python names and values, a wonderfully clear
exposition on how python stores values.  I recommend this talk to
anyone new to python, it will likely save you a few hours of chasing
mysterious bugs.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="gary-bernhardt">
<h2>Gary Bernhardt</h2>
<p>Gary Bernhardt followed up his <em>Rise and fall of javascript</em> from last
year with a closing keynote motivated by Donald Rumsfeld's
<em>known-unknowns</em> speech.  He talked about beliefs programmers have,
that really have an underlying belief driving them.  Discovering that
underlying belief is the key to being able to discuss these ideas with
others that have differing views.  He gave an example along these
lines.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Python needs tests because it does not have static typing
</pre>
<pre class="literal-block">
I don't need tests because I have types
</pre>
<p>Gary pointed out that these two statements cannot both be true, unless
tests are somehow the same as types and eloquently exposed the
underlying beliefs behind these statements.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="not-all-python">
<h2>Not all Python</h2>
<p>PyCon is by no means all python.</p>
<p>There were talks on <em>Advanced Git</em>, ethics, inclusivity, freedom, the
brokenness of TLS (https).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="not-all-talks">
<h2>Not all talks</h2>
<p>The Expo Hall where conference sponsors had their booths also served
as the breakfast and lunch place.  As per last year, I found the Expo
Hall a valuable place to spend time.</p>
<p>The vast majority of sponsors booths are run by techies, not
marketting droids and they are great place to find others with similar
interests.</p>
<p>Meal times give an opportunity to sit at a random table and meet
others and share ideas.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="magic">
<h2>MAGIC</h2>
<p>I have been interested in the MAGIC center at Rochester Institute of
Technology since hearing Remy DeCausemaker speak about it last year.</p>
<p>MAGIC allows students to take a minor in Open Source.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="lightning-talks">
<h2>Lightning talks</h2>
<p>Lightning talks are always fun, often at the end of the day.  Speakers
have precisely 5 minutes to talk.  If you want to give a talk, just
sign up on the board.  These are usually over-subscribed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="poster-sessions">
<h2>Poster Sessions</h2>
<p>Sunday morning the expo hall switched into a combined jobs fair and
poster sessions.   The poster sessions were small booths where people
created posters relating to projects and ideas they are working on.</p>
<p>You can then wander around and talk to people working on ideas you are
also interested in.  These complement the talks in that it gives a
chance for more detailed discussion with the people running the
projects.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="live-captioning">
<h2>Live captioning</h2>
<p>Most of the talks had live captioning.  This captioning was remarkably
good with essentially real time display.  It even coped well with
speakers that added a bit of French.</p>
</div>

<h2>Keynotes</h2>
<p>Jacob Kaplan-Moss's <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIJdFxYlEKE">keynote</a> reflected the focus on inclusivity in the
python community.  He talked about how programmers are all perceived
either to <em>rock</em> or <em>suck</em>.  In short we are led to believe that the
distribution of programming abilities is essentially an upside down
bell-curve.</p>
<p>Jacob pointed out the absurdity of this perception and also its very
damaging consequences.  The reality is that programming ability, like
most attributes, should follow a normal distribution, hence the vast
majority of programmers are just average or as Jacob described
himself, <em>I am a mediocre programmer</em>.</p>
<p>The python community is full of people who use python in order to get
other stuff done in a very wide range of activities.  It is widely
used in science, finance, education and a plethora of other areas.</p>
<p>As such, you will often hear pythonistas say, "I am not a real
programmer".   I would include myself in this bracket, despite having
spent my entire working career building software of one sort or
another.  But that software has always been a means to an end.</p>
<p>I believe my reality is closer to being <em>good enough</em> at quite a lot
of things and having the capacity to become <em>good enough</em> at anything
I am passionate enough about to pursue.</p>
<p>But to get there you have to deal with the <em>little hater</em>.  The voice
that eats away at you saying, "You suck at this".   Many software
communities will confirm this belief for you.  The python community is
trying to be different.</p>
<p>By insisting that all programmers <em>rock</em> we are excluding the vast
majority of programmers from that activity.  This causes angst for
those already pursuing at the activity and dramatically increases the
barrier to entry.  The result is a smaller, less diverse, less
interesting and less effective community.</p>
<p>Thanks Jacob for a truly inspiring talk.  Thanks also to the python
community for recognising and trying to address this issue.</p>

<h2>Sprinting</h2>
<p>My flight home was not until Monday evening, so I was able to attend
the first day of code sprints.</p>
<p>Once the conference closed on Sunday afternoon, sprint leaders were
given a couple of minutes to talk about what they would be working
on.</p>
<p>There was then an introductory session organised, primarily aimed at
people new to sprinting, but also of great benefit to more experienced
sprinters.</p>
<p>There were people giving introductions to git, virtualenv, virtualbox,
testing in python, http and more.  Each introduction was repeated 3
times in 15 minute sessions.  Hence, everyone could listed to three
subjects of there choice.</p>
<p>I found this a useful session to fill in some gaps in my knowledge and
also to get to know some of the other sprinters.</p>

<h2>PyCon videos</h2>
<p>If this blog post has sparked your interest in PyCon I would encourage
you to watch some videos from the talks.  Just go to youtube and
search for PyCon 2015.  See the <a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/">schedule</a> if you want to see the
full list of talks.</p>

<h2>The state of the python</h2>
<p>One of the reasons I like to attend PyCon is that you get a very good
feel for where the language and community is currently placed, what
projects are being widely used, what projects are up and coming and
generally where the community is heading.</p>
<p>I have watched PyCon grow and be delighted that it has not lost the
excitement and sheer inspiration it always generates.</p>
<p>The community is stronger than ever and making great efforts to be
more inclusive and accessible.</p>
<div class="section" id="python-3-x">
<h3>Python 3.x</h3>
<p>Guido in his keynote spoke again about the challenges of moving to
Python 3.  Whilst there are still large numbers of projects that have
not been ported (Guido quoted only 5,000 out of 55,000 on PyPi),
things are actually way better than that.</p>
<p>All of the top 1000 most used projects have been ported.  The reality
is that if you are starting a new project, python 3.x is a great
choice.  You will be using projects that are in active development.</p>
<p>If you are maintaining a large body of python 2.x code then that is
where things become more challenging.  It only takes one critical
package that is not ported and you are stuck.  Indeed, this is why
the process of moving to python 3.x has taken so long, a project
cannot be ported until all its dependencies are also ported.</p>
<p>My takeaway from this PyCon was that more than ever people are using
and enjoying python 3.x.  I think we are moving to a time when
new packages will be available under python 3.x and not under python
2.x and this will provide incentive to switch.</p>

<h3>Micro Bit</h3>
<p>The UK, in a project driven by the BBC is planning to give 1 million
school children a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/mediapacks/makeitdigital/micro-bit">Micro Bit</a> computer.  These are small raspberry pi
like devices.  Python will be used as one of the languages to use on
the device.</p>
<p>More generally, python is widely used in education.  The Python
Software Foundation deserves a lot of credit for this, there has been
a huge amount of work over many years promoting the language in
education and it is reaping rewards.</p>

<p>I have felt for a while that when the Blades win, the Sens also seem
to do better.  When the Blades lose, the Sens don't do so well.</p>
<p>My guess is this is mostly just perspective, but I follow both teams.
Blades, or Sheffield United, are hoping to get a place in the League 1
play-offs.  The Sens, or Ottawa Senators, are trying to get into the
Stanley Playoffs.</p>
<p>If you'd asked me at the start of the year, I would have thought being
about where we are was a distinct possibility.  I still felt we might
push into the top two.  That would get us up to the Championship
automatically.</p>
<p>The Sens on the other hand appeared to be going nowhere.  Until the
inevitable sacking of the coach to be replaced by Dave Cameron, who
was the assistant up to that point.  And for a while nothing changed,
but then a new goalie was brought in, due to injuries.  Since then
they have been on a run.</p>
<p>The last few games have been just like watching the Blades.  The
Blades never (well almost never) do it the easy way.  So it is always
a season of maybe, just waiting for the point where it all unravels.</p>
<p>But this Sens run has been different.  They are already way beyond
what anyone could have hoped for a few months back.  But now they are
tantalisingly close to a playoffs, with a team that is playing well
and having fun.  But like the Blades, they've been doing it the hard
way.  3-0 leads disappearing, coming from behind to go on and win in
over-time.</p>

</h2>
<p>So, there has been a lot going on and my guess is that anything
that might be in the data will be better explained by major changes such
as of coaching staff or players.</p>
<p>So first problem, getting the data.  I am planning to just get this season's results for both teams and extract the days when they both played, then take a look at how the results lined up.</p>

</h2>
<p>The mighty Blades had a key game against local rivals Doncaster.  As
per usual, they did things the hard way, coming from behind twice to
end up winners 3-2.</p>
<p>That is two big wins over local rivals in a matter of days.  The
Blades are now firmly in the playoff positions, one more win from the
last three games might be all that is needed.</p>
<p>Another local side, Chesterfield, are looming large.  It feels like
they will play a part in the rest of our season.  I grew up on the
Chesterfield side of Sheffield, almost equidistant from the two
grounds.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Senators were at home to the Pittsburgh Penguins last
night, in what really was a must win game.</p>
<p>It was also fan appreciation night.  Within 10 seconds of the start
they were 1-0 down.  By 5 minutes in they were 2-0 down and by the end
of the first period it was 3-0.  Oh dear.  Sid Crosby on form and the
young Sens not firing.</p>
<p>Second period was a different story.  Sens put the Penguins under
pressure, but nothing finding the net, until 5 minutes from the end of
the period.  Pageau managed to sneak one in off one of the Penguin's
skates.</p>
<p>30 seconds into the third period they got a second.  Two minutes from
time they equalised and then Mark Stone fired in the winner in
overtime.</p>
<p>Now that is what I call a fan appreciation night.</p>
<p>Oh, and Blades and Sens both win on the same night, so that hypothesis
is proven ;)</p>
