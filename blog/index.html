<p>For the 80 days project I decided to use the <a class="reference external" href="http://django-allauth.readthedocs.org/">django-allauth</a> package
to handle authentication.</p>
<p>When I say I decided, the decision was actually made by the django
project <a class="reference external" href="https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">cookiecutter</a> I used to create the project.</p>
<p>This should provide lots of goodness in that it will allow users to
register and log in to the site using social media OpenID
authentication.  At least, I think that what it does.</p>

<p>The other day, Nick Hoskins posted a link to an intriguing puzzle, the
<a class="reference external" href="https://imitationgame.withgoogle.com/">Imitation Game Puzzle</a></p>
<p>I tried very hard not to click on the link.  There was a picture of
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan Turing</a>, a puzzle and a competition.  Oh, and it was all run
by the <a class="reference external" href="https://google.com">Chocolate Factory</a>.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2084970/">The Imitation Game</a> film has just been released, hence the timing of
the puzzle.</p>
<p>I clicked on the link.   Pictures of the bombe's that were used to
break Enigma in the Second World War.  Another picture of Alan Turing
and a little piece about the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test">Turing Test</a>.</p>
<p>In fact, one of the premises of the puzzle was to prove you are not a
computer, in effect a reverse Turing Test.</p>
<p>I clicked on the link to download the pdf with the details of the
puzzle.  I was delighted to find what looked like a scan of a
type-written document.  This reminded me of working on puzzles with my
mum.</p>
<p>My mum loved crosswords.  Her favourite was to find a puzzle in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk">The
Guardian</a> compiled by <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Galbraith_Graham">Araucaria</a>.  I can still recall her telling
me how araucaria is the Latin name for tne <em>monkey puzzle</em> tree, with
a twinkle in her eye.</p>
<p>At holiday times Araucaria would often create a special, puzzle.  The
puzzles could keep you amused for days.   We would both take a look at
them, get a few clues, then give up in despair.  Mum would usually be
more persistent than me.   Maybe she would be cooking dinner and I
would be sat talking to her in the kitchen.  Happiness was solving a
clue together.</p>
<p>One thing I learnt from this is that talking to others about problems
helps you see them more clearly.  My mind works that way for sure.  It
doesn't matter if the person you are talking fully understands, so
long as they are engaged and interested it helps you find out what
assumptions you are making, it raises questions and you get a second
perspective on the problem.</p>
<p>Mum used to subscribe to special puzzles that Araucaria produced a few
times a year.   They would arrive in the post, printed on paper and
looked like they were copies of an original from a type-writer -- just
like the Imitation Game puzzle.   I was hooked.</p>
<p>Earlier this year I visited Bletchley Park with my wife and family.
The two boys are very interested in history and know way more than
anyone of their age normally does about the world wars.  Indeed, if a
Turing Test was done on either of them you might well conclude that
they are in fact computers since no human being could reasonably be
expected to know as much as they do.</p>
<p>The visit to Bletchley was a bit disappointing, our timing was bad as
they were just putting the finishing touches to some new exhibits so
parts of the museum were closed.  However, we did get to see the
re-constructed bombe working.   These bombe's were basically
electro-mechanical special purpose parallel computers.  They allowed
vast numbers of enigma settings to be tried as the initial part of an
attack on the Enigma ciphers.</p>
<p>The competition is still on-going, so I should not spoil the fun.
Suffice to say, the puzzle came at just the right time for me.</p>
<p>I have been going through a very difficult time, so to be able to get
away from everything for a few hours and immerse myself in the puzzle
was very therapeutic.</p>
<p>My poor wife had to put up with an entire weekend of bizarre questions
about a whole range of strange subjects.  She was an immense help as I
worked through the puzzle.  I was reminded of sitting round the
kitchen table with my mother, happy times indeed.</p>
<p>Araucaria would have been proud of this puzzle, many thanks to those
at Google that created the puzzle and helped me through this very
difficult time.</p>

<p>This theme from the global <a class="reference external" href="https://koding.com/Hackathon">hackathon</a>  really interests me:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Challenges associated with real time communication and translation
(Star Trek universal translator anyone?)
</pre>
<p>I am finding computer interfaces becoming more and more annoying.  I
interact with computers through different interfaces: mobile phones,
tablets, infra-red remotes, workstations etc etc.</p>
<p>Each application has its own idea of how it wants me to work with it.
Some have discoverable interfaces.  Some are close to unusable from a
mobile phone.</p>
<p>What I am thinking is what we need is a layer that sits between input
devices and applications.   I guess we already have this, it is called
an operating system.   But currently, all these tend to do is
implement the drivers needed to talk to the input device and simply
pass on the events to applications running on the O/S.</p>
<p>Events tend to be pretty low level things like <em>button click</em>,
<em>keyboard keypress</em> etc etc.   If we had more sophisticated input
devices, or rather a layer listening to existing inputs (for instance
why not use the webcam too to observe what the user is doing, or the
mic to listen.  With this information it ought to be easier to guess
what the user is really trying to do.   Applications could then be
build that accepted a much richer set of events.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>go to next page</li>
<li>go back, I just clicked the screen by mistake</li>
<li>damn you autocorrect, stop guessing and just enter the word I have
typed three times already</li>
<li>OK, usually when he does this he wants out of netflix and into xbmc,
so why don't I just offer to take him there?</li>
<li>of course, the OS should learn from you as you interact with it</li>
<li>and we don't want to end up with <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Assistant">clippy</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then there is social media, I am signed up to way to many sevices:
twitter, email, google+, github, facebook, koding.com, irc, blogs etc
etc.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://ttwick.com/">ttwick</a> looks like it might have a solution to the problem of keeping
track of everything.</p>
<p>There are a whole bunch of privacy issues to worry about here.  Any
interface listening to user inputs is seeing some very personal
information.  My guess is the way you type on a keyboard is a pretty
unique identifier, perhaps as distinctive as your DNA.</p>
<p>So for apps to really behave well for you they might need to know this
information that identifies who you are.  But who do you really want
to share that information with?</p>
<p>Now if the OS translated the inputs coming from devices into a
standard, rich event stream then it might be that it could do it in
such a way as the event stream was less of a personal marker and so we
could get a double win of greater privacy and a more unified interface
to interact with computers.</p>
<p>This whole area is really an accessibility thing.  But for too long
accessibility has been some extra thing you do to support people with
disabilities.  It isn't built into apps from the ground up.  Further,
it singles out those with disabilities: poor vision, paralysis, poor
motor skills, etc etc.   The reality is that everyone needs better
interfaces.</p>
<p>If we out a layer between our input devices and our applications we
can start working on those better interfaces.  For everybody.</p>
<p>I am reminded of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWyMA_bT7UI">Tavis Rudd</a> at PyCon 2014 talking about controlling
emacs with his voice.</p>
<p>So again, all we need here is a layer listening to his voice and
converting the voice into instructions for emacs.  Now if that layer
could learn as it was used, we might have something special.</p>

    <div>
<p>Over at <a class="reference external" href="../posts/https//koding.com">koding.com</a> they are running a global hackathon for the
weekend of 6/7 December.   It is an exciting project, with people
participating all over the world.</p>
<p>The idea is for teams of up to 5 to work on projects along the
following 5 themes:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Problems facing our planet, explained using interactive data visualization. (e.g. climate change, earthquakes, food/water waste, etc.)</li>
<li>Introducing software development to a beginner (games!)</li>
<li>No one reads the fine print (ie TOS, EULA, legal documents) anymore yet every site has them. Devise a creative/interactive solution.</li>
<li>HTML5 games that are educational and learning oriented. (multiplayer preferred)</li>
<li>Challenges associated with real time communication and translation
(Star Trek universal translator anyone?)</li>
</ol>
<p>There are some great themes there, many of them relate directly to
Bermuda.   For example, maybe we could build a simple hurricane model,
using data from the recent storms to allow people to explore the
impact of global warming on Bermuda.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I have been working on this 80 days project.  Progress is
proving difficult due to the amount of wonderful stuff there is out
there that can be used in the project.</p>
<p>I am hoping to be able to use the hackathon to learn a couple more
tools and to start making real progress on 80 days.</p>
<p>It would also be interesting to try and work with hackers on other
small islands.  One challenge here in Bermuda is, at least for now,
our numbers are small.  Other small islands have similary issues.</p>
<p>It would be good if we could perhaps work with people at the <a class="reference external" href="http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/Cyberhippietotalism">Lanzarote
hackbase</a>.</p>
<p>From a personal point of view, I also have some contacts in Ireland,
so maybe we could stretch the definition of small a little to include
Ireland too.</p>
<p>Then there are the Azores and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Theme 5 is all about translation.  It would be cool if we could make
our site multi-lingual:  English, Portuguese, Bermudian slang etc,
etc.</p>
<p>One suggestion is to actually work towards having another hackathon
event in the near future, a <em>Small Island Hackathon</em>.   Is there any
interest in using the global hackathon as an opportunity to build a
site for a small island event.   Perhaps we could have it coincide
with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bermudaraceweekend.com/site/">Bermuda Race Weekend</a> January 16-18th 2015.</p>

<p>I have been spending some time looking at tools to help with the 80
days project.</p>
<div class="section" id="nikola">
<h2>nikola</h2>
<p>First up on the list was <a class="reference external" href="http://getnikola.com/">nikola</a>.   This is a static site generator.
I was mostly interested in it because:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>it plays nicely with <a class="reference external" href="https://pages.github.com/">gh-pages</a>
</li>
<li>it allows you to write blog entries with <a class="reference external" href="http://ipython.org/notebook.html">ipython notebooks</a>
</li>
<li>it is built in python.</li>
</ul>
<p>I ran into one problem with nikola, see this <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/getnikola/nikola/issues/1496">nikola_issue</a></p>
<p>Happily, within three minutes of reporting the problem the maintainer
posted a solution, even though the issue I reported was a dupe.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="django-packages-and-cookiecutter">
<h2>django packages and cookiecutter</h2>
<p>Since I am working on a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">django</a> project I took a look at <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangopackages.com/">django
packages</a>.</p>
<p>My attention was quickly drawn by <a class="reference external" href="https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">cookiecutter</a> in the featured
grid. Cookie cutter creates projects from templates, so saving a lot
of tedious work.  It comes with a list of available cookiecutters.</p>
<p>I was a bit spoilt for choice, but I decided to give the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-djangopackage">cookiecutter
djangopackage</a> a go.</p>
<p>So far I am pleased with this choice.  The docs led me through
creating the django app, adding it to <a class="reference external" href="http://django-eighty-days.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">readthedocs</a> and registering
it with <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=pkg_edit&amp;name=django-eighty-days">PyPi</a></p>
<p>All in all, a very painless way to get lots of goodies up and running
for the project.</p>
<p>Now I just need to write some actual code.</p>
