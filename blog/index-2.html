<p>I am now 33 days into the project and anyone reading this blog ought
to be wondering how it is actually going.</p>
<p>One thing I am enjoying about this project is there is no project
manager.  Well I guess, technically, that is my job.</p>
<p>I have been writing code long enough to see more than my share of
magic bullets that will make everything go smoothly.  Sometimes these
were formal approaches to coding and project management.  Other times
the bullets are coming from the open source community: ways of working
that people have developed for themselves.</p>
<p>In general, the open source stuff speaks for itself.  Nobody is
mandating that the projects work the way they do (actually, in most
cases the BDFL is probably mandating the standards).  But the point is
that the standards are being driven by those that know the job best.</p>
<p>Around the time Extreme Programming became popular I encountered the
following:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Time, resources, scope and quality:  pick any three
</pre>
<p>Fix three of these and then you have to let those doing the work tell
you what the fourth will likely be.  I find this to be a very useful
tool.  Letting others set all four is a recipe for failure.</p>
<p>In the 80 days project I am fortunate.  Time is set to 80 days, but I
pretty much have control over the other three.</p>
<p>Actually, that is not quite true.  As far as <em>scope</em> is concerned I
will need to deliver something by February 1st and actually need
somewhere people can register for the competition by January 1st (give
or take a few days).  But overall, the scope will be whatever gets
done in the time available.</p>
<p>Resources are to some extent under my control.  Right now there is
only me working on the project.  Actually, that is not really true.
There is a whole army of open source heroes working on this project,
they just don't know they are working on it.</p>
<p>So far I really have not written much code.  However, I do have a site
that has a pretty landing page, and about page and you can register
either by setting up <em>yet another user id and password</em> or by using
your google ID and open auth.</p>
<p>I didn't have to write any code bar a tiny bit of html and a fair bit
of configuration of django.  Mostly it has just been a matter of
finding packages, reading how they work, follow the instructions.</p>
<p>To some extent, this whole project is turning into an exercise in how
little code I actually have to write.  Code re-use is working well for
now.</p>
<div class="section" id="hosting">
<h2>Hosting</h2>
<p>The site is not available in the big bad world as yet, mostly due to
the fact I have not decided where to host it as yet.</p>
<p>Since I had a good experience with <a class="reference external" href="../posts/https//koding.com">koding.com</a> during the recent
hackathon, that is probably what I will end up using.  The good news
is that I know all the stuff I am using will only take about 30
minutes to get up and running on that platform.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-is-left-to-do">
<h2>What is left to do</h2>
<p>Pretty much all the details of the site, but this is most of the fun
stuff.</p>
<p>I am planning to create a couple of new django apps.  <em>django teams</em>
will be a simple app to manage teams.  A team is just a set of
competitors, but will have some other attributes such as team size.</p>
<p>I might include <em>competitions</em> in this app, since teams will be busy
entering competitions.</p>
<p>Another app I am thinking about is <em>django routes</em>.   This is a key
part of the 80 days project: we need a route that we are going to take
around the world.  A route is really just an ordered set of places.</p>
<p>However, the same app ought to be useful for the <em>around Bermuda Bus
in 80 days</em> idea I keep thinking about.  Buses follow routes.</p>
<p>There is the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/tomwalker/django_quiz/">django quiz</a> project that I am hoping to use to add
quizzes to the competition.  The idea is that each time a team arrives
in a city along the route there will be a little quiz.  Get the
questions right and you will get some free miles en route to the next
city.</p>
<p>I am betting there is already something out there to help with <em>django
routes</em>, perhaps I can make use of something written to work with the
transport data format <a class="reference external" href="https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/">GTFS</a>.</p>
<p>All in all, I think the project is on target.</p>

<p>We had a friend over the other evening.  I have a home full of half
working tech.  Stuff that really could do something, given enough
time.</p>
<p>A lot of my techy stuff has been neglected for a few years, so it is
suffering both bit and hardware rot.  So a good part of last night was
spent exploring why stuff wasn't working, in between finding a few
gems.</p>
<p>So today, I had a few things I wanted to look into:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>why wasn't the server with the music on responding,</li>
<li>installing a fedora iso onto a usb and seeing what it is like.</li>
</ul>
<p>That server with the music; well that thing won't even boot off a USB
key; though you can change a bucket load of things in the BIOS.  And
at one point it did seem like it would boot over the network.</p>
<p>Next stop, fedora install guide kindly gives the incantation:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
dd if=fedora*.iso of=/dev/sdx  (x in my case was b)
</pre>
<p>So I booted up a laptop (the one with the battery that lasts 30
seconds) off the USB and fedora booted.  I did not have time to have a
good look around, but it seemed snappier and easier to use than the
Ubuntu desktop on the machine, more like the <cite>awesome wm</cite> experience.
I will definitely take a nother look at this.</p>
<p>Back to the music.  I resurrected an old mythtv box and tried to put
fedora on it.  I couldn't get it to install on the old myth box.  It
may have had something to do with some network issues that were going
on at the time.  Also possible there was some issue with this boxes
USB, it was an old machine, so might have old firmware.  Or the USB
isn't an innocent little USB.  But I digress.</p>
<p>So, I tried arch.  This was like being beamed back to 1997.  It was fun
for a while, but then I typed the wrong thing and lost the internet
connection, which was what I needed to get the software to fix the
internet connection.  I did Ctrl-D out of the <em>chroot</em> and if I'd been
awake when I booted back into it I might have skipped the second
install.  I gave up at the bootloader bit.  I know, I was nearly there :(</p>
<p>I might have to go back to arch one day when I have lots of time on my
hands.</p>
<p>So more rabbit holes.  Eventually, led to Debian.  By now the dining
table is buried under cables.  The IP over powerline is up and running
again and 2-3 boxes are in the pile marked broken.</p>
<p>The Debian install was been a joy, apart from the sporadic (or rather
repeated) interruptions to anything needing internet bandwidth (a
problem anywhere with expensive or unreliable bandwidth).</p>
<p>I suspect I am biassed because over the years I have spent more time
with Debian based systems.  First with debian and then indirectly via
Ubuntu.</p>
<p>I liked Ubuntu primarily for its python packaging.  Ubuntu still is a
fantastic distribution for python.  As an interface for the sort of
programming I like to do it is becoming less responsive, or at least
that is my feeling.  Also, I am feeling myself further removed from
the hardware and the software configuration.</p>
<p>At the same time, python packaging has come a long way.  With PyPi and
pip install the linux distro no longer matters so much.</p>
<p>Debian doesn't seem to have changed much in philosophy.  Most of what
I learnt back in the day still applies.  It led me through the install
with just enough information to make an informed decision about the
questions.  It guided pretty well, hinting which way I should go.</p>
<p>As of now I am yet to actually get it serving up the music, so this
will most likely not be the last distro related posting.</p>

<p>Last weekend I took part in the <a class="reference external" href="../posts/worlds-first-global-hackathon.html">global hackathon</a> run by
<a class="reference external" href="../posts/https//koding.com">koding.com</a> as part of Team Bermuda aka <em>Three</em> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=aceboy">ace-boys</a> <em>and an</em>
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Acegirl">ace-girl</a>.</p>
<p>The other members of the team were:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Nick Hoskins, the one who told us all about it</li>
<li>Beckett Simmons, residing <a class="reference external" href="../posts/https//koding.com">koding.com</a> expert</li>
<li>Veronica Windus, working remotely from the frozen wastes of Canada</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea was to create a web based application in 48 hours.  There
were five themes to choose from, we chose:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
No one reads the fine print (ie TOS, EULA, legal documents) anymore
yet every site has them. Devise a creative/interactive solution.
</pre>
<p>So, before we could start we needed a name.</p>
<p>Since the average EULA is about as easy to read as the classic, James
Joyce' <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_%28novel%29">Ulysees</a> we took the liberty of borrowing the name, and then
abusing it and came up with, <em>Eulasees</em>.</p>
<p>There is a tenuous link with Bermuda in that many songs of <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Moore">Thomas
Moore</a> who lived in Bermuda for a while, are cited in the works of
James Joyce.</p>
<p>So, back to the hackathon.  This nominally started at 4am Bermuda time
on Saturday 6th December.  Team Bermuda hence decided to start work at
10am, gathering at the Watford Sports Club.</p>
<p>In fact, things got off to a slow start due to several factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="first">lack of coffee.</p>
<p>Actually, there was coffee, but we only had a tiny bodum to make it
in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">A fellow <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield_United_F.C.">Blade</a> turned up at the sports club.</p>
<p>These days, blades are rare as hen's teeth, so progress came to a
complete standstill whilst yours truly reminisced about the good old
days when the Mighty Blades were in the heady heights of the first
division (technically, they are still in the first division, it is
just that now first really means third, English footy uses a weird
number system).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">At least one of us working on a laptop that was missing lots of the
standard development packages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">Flaky wifi.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">No real idea what we were going to do.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This was very much a <em>make it up as you go along</em> event.   We talked
about a few ideas, delegated lots of stuff to our ace-girl, who was
presumably still digging out from under a snow storm.</p>
<p>The rough plan was a to create a restful API with <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">django</a> and build
an <a class="reference external" href="https://angularjs.org/">angular.js</a> front end.</p>
<p>The idea was to load EULA's into the system, allow users to highlight
areas of text and apply <em>tags</em> to these areas.</p>
<p>These <em>tags</em> would have a short name indicating what the contract
clause really meant and a longer text body explaining what it was all
about really.</p>
<p>Once we had this and some data in the system the plan was to create
some views allowing users to see which EULA's had which clauses and
other such fun stuff.  One idea was to add a quiz, getting people to
guess whose EULA had which clause, possibly using <cite>django quiz</cite>.</p>
<p>For most of Saturday we pretty much ignored the <a class="reference external" href="../posts/https//koding.com">koding.com</a> virtual
machine, we were having enough other problems.</p>
<p>Actually, the <em>angular</em> stuff was going quite well.</p>
<p>The django side was going a bit slower.  We were using <a class="reference external" href="https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">cookiecutter</a>
to create all the base files for our django apps and project.  This
works really well, but does come with a lot of extra goodness that we
probably did not need at this point.</p>
<p><em>pip install</em> kept failing on obscure compile errors due to missing
<em>-dev</em> packages.  I love pip, but with a big requirements list and a
dodgy wifi connection the downloads were taking way too long and I
couldn't get it to cache things reliably.  More on this later.</p>
<p>Having said that, being able to do:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
python setup.py register
</pre>
<p>Followed by:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
python setup.py publish
</pre>
<p>To make the django app available on PyPi (and hence <em>pip install</em>
magic just works), was very cool.</p>
<p>Things went well on the Saturday.   Mid-evening we stopped for food
and more coffee (by now Nick had brought a decent sized bodum down
from his house, so the coffee shortage was averted).</p>
<p>We decided to work until we were too tired, then get some sleep ready
to code until 4am on Monday morning.</p>
<p>It is all a bit of a blur now, but at some point we decided we should
see if any of our stuff actually works on <a class="reference external" href="../posts/https//koding.com">koding.com</a>.</p>
<p>I am sure the koding.com IDE is a joy to use, but now was not the time
to learn it.  Fortunately, Beckett had given us the number one pro-tip
for using koding.com:</p>
<blockquote>
Getting ssh to koding working is well worth the effort</blockquote>
<p>Further, it didn't involve anything more than adding an ssh key to the
<em>~/.ssh/.authorized_keys</em> file.</p>
<p>Suddenly <em>pip install</em> was flying along.  Clearly, we should have been
doing everything on the koding machine.</p>
<p>Having noted how well the koding VM was working, of course, we
continued to work locally.</p>
<p>We were, in fact, so effective at this that it was midnight on Sunday
before we decided it would be a good idea if the angular front end
could talk to the django rest API.</p>
<p>No prizes for guessing the answer to this: hell no.</p>
<p>Angular was either failing completely to connect to the django API
giving obscure messages about <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery">cross-site request forgery</a></p>
<p>At this point we probably should have left the angular front end as an
example of where we were heading and just fed it some toy data.</p>
<p>Instead we learnt way more about csrf's than we ever wanted to know,
in between cursing django for its attentiveness to security.</p>
<p>After much thrashing around <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ottoyiu/django-cors-headers">django cors</a> came to the rescue.  By
now, however, it was past 3am and Nick was having to use a new
function to make the restful API calls.</p>
<p>We got the two pieces talking, but ran out of time to fix up enough of
the angular code to get a viable front end.</p>
<p>The project code is on github, as <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/swfiua/eulasees">eulasees</a>, with the the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/swfiua/django_eulasees">django
eulasees</a> app in a separate repository.</p>
<p>You can also view the docs for the <a class="reference external" href="http://swfiua.koding.io:8000/docs/">eulasees API</a> that was created.
These are created with the amazing <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/marcgibbons/django-rest-swagger">django rest swagger</a> and allow
you to try out the API.</p>
<p>We did manage to load some data into the system, with the django admin
system coming to the rescue as the user interface of last resort.</p>
<p>We should probably apologise to google, since their <a class="reference external" href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/">terms of
service</a> was the toy example we decided to use.  You can actually get
all the data that we entered with this <a class="reference external" href="http://swfiua.koding.io:8000/eulasees/everythingforeula/4/">one API call</a>.  So, if there
are any google lawyers reading: we love you really, we know you are
not <em>evil</em>.  Just one question: what is with the paragraphs IN ALL
CAPS?  ARE WE BACK IN THE 90's ON A SHOUTY FORUM?</p>
<p>Remarkably, we got an email yesterday informing us we made it through
to the next round of the competition.  We can only assume that pretty
much everyone that got any sort of site up got through the first
round.  You can even <a class="reference external" href="http://hackathon.koding.com/entries/team-bermuda">VOTE FOR US</a> :)</p>
