<h2>1   Update</h2>
<p>PyCaribbean is in the Dominican Republic in February.  There is a lot
happening between now and then.</p>
<p>I have been working on slides and thoughts for a talk at the
conference.  I need some tools to help me give presentations and am
enjoying working with the tools alongside thinking about what I would
like to talk about.</p>
<p>I've also been building simple tools to turn my scripts into
slideshows.</p>
<p>I am mostly using photos I have taken, mainly because it is too much
work to check copyright etc.</p>
<p>But also I have some images that each come with many stories.  And
there are a lot of stories.</p>
<p>In the process I have been working with restructured text, markdown,
python, feh, eog and more.</p>
<p>Most of the software is in the <em>noddy</em> folder of the <em>blog</em> branch,</p>
<p>Note to self: I should make this branch master and switch master to
80days -- probably is a separate project.</p>
<p>I also need to write some install instructions, for now, add noddy to
your path and watch out.  Read the code first, there isn't much, but
it gets powerful, quickly.</p>
<p>At the moment the best place to find some of what I am thinking about
is here:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://openbermuda.org/80days/blog/">http://openbermuda.org/80days/blog/</a></p>
<p>And the noddy code is here:</p>

<h2>2   Description</h2>
<p>Community weather and climate:</p>
<blockquote>
Combining local expertise with global collaboration to understand
and mitigate the impacts of our changing climate. Particular
reference to Atlantic hurricanes and their impact on the
Caribbean. How we can work together to provide life saving
information and understanding.</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="abstract">
<h2>3   Abstract</h2>
<p>I'm working to develop python and free software community here in
Bermuda. The potential is huge, and it can have a really positive
impact here and beyond. But things take time.</p>
<p>There is a lot of expertise in hurricanes. We have had three here in
just over a year.</p>
<p>Every season brings new insights. The models are getting good, but
still need careful interpretation.</p>
<p>One notable feature this year was that there was significant
uncertainty in the paths that storms would take, but the models were
able to give good insight on the impact given a particular track.</p>
<p>Compute resources are cheap these days, even the power to run them can
be provided by solar, wind or wave.</p>
<p>By sharing data and simulating multiple models across locations we can
provide more information to help mitigate the impact of storms.</p>
<p>Further, we can provide risk analyses for the likely impact of current
and future human behaviour on our climate.</p>

<p>I will be looking for images to illustrate each point.  Let's say 30
images, 1 minute a piece.</p>
<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h3>4.1   Introduction</h3>
<p>I have worked with risk managements systems over the last 18 years.
Through this time I have been working with open source software, using
great tools to build systems to assess risk.</p>
<p>Hurricanes have always been an interest.  Much of this time I have
been living in Bermuda, where I now live.  I have a keen interest in
weather and climate.</p>
<p>Climate change presents challenges to risk modelling and weather
forecasting.</p>
<p>There have been significant developments in computing, especially the
low cost and low power raspberry pi.</p>
<p>Software developments too.  Making things.</p>
<p>Data, data, everywhere.</p>
<p>I will begin with some observations from the last two Atlantic
hurricane seasons.</p>

<h3>4.4   Personal weather stations</h3>
<p>Raspberry pi's provide a cheap way to create simple weather
stations. A simple station that measures air pressure, temperature and
humidity can be built for less than $50.</p>
<p>The power requirements are low, so stations can be powered by solar
trickle charging a small battery.</p>
<p>Anemometers and wind direction sensors are valuable additions to
have and can be built at reasonably low cost.</p>
<div class="section" id="learning">
<h4>4.4.1   Learning</h4>
<p>Building these stations is an excellent project for a school or
college.</p>
<p>Once built, these provide lots of opportunities for school projects
related to weather.</p>
<p>In particular, studying the data from the stations can provide
interesting insights.</p>
<p>For example, when I built a station myself, I learnt that the
atmosphere is tidal.</p>

<p>This data could also be used to estimate rainfall.  With rainfall
readings from lots of weather stations it should be possible to
calibrate models and gain better insight into rainfall within storms.</p>
