The idea is to create an 80 day challenge whereby teams of 5 people
collect miles as they do exercises and see how far round the world
they can get in 80 days.

The aim is to create a web site where people can enter the competition
and log their activities through the 80 day competition. Different
activities will generate different numbers of miles.

But the 80 day concept goes beyond this.  It turns out 80 days is a
good timeframe to think about when working on a project.  Technology
is changing so fast nowadays that it is hard to look beyond that.

So, the idea is come up with your goals for the next 80 days.  During
those 80 days make it up as you go along, pretty much as `Phileas
Fogg`_ had to on his journet.

And at the end of 80 days, just rinse and repeat.

Blog
====

My plan is to blog as the project progresses.

See the `eighty days project blog`_ if you want to follow the project.

I have a habit of changing blog platform from time to time.  A couple
of my previous blogs are `jackanory`_ and `bytes and bikes`_.

I might go back to Jackanory at some point, but for now I am on an 80
day schedule.


80 days of coding
=================

The aim is to launch the competition on February 1st. By a happy
coincidence I started work on the project on 13th November, 2014. This
gives precisely 80 days until launch.

So, a secondary goal here is to see what can be created in 80 days of
coding.

Other competitions
==================

The idea is to build open source libraries that
will enable 80 day sites to be built.

Hopefully, many organisations will be interested in running
competitions. Currently, the project is focussed on competitions local
to Bermuda.

Further, the aim is to use the 80 days to create other Bermuda related
sites around the 80 day theme.

Some ideas include:

* Around Bermuda Bus in 80 days: how many miles can you clock up on Bermuda bus and ferry in 80 days?
* Bermuda football: is there any interest from the Bermuda football
  and cricket clubs in running a competition?
* Something related to the upcoming America's Cup

Help and mentoring
==================

If you have ideas or want to help, just send me a message at
swfiua@gmail.com or just create an issue here.

If you are not sure you have the skills but are interested in helping
and learning, just let me know, another goal here is to teach others
new skills whilst building cool stuff.
