 Proposal for community weather in Bermuda
===========================================

Bermuda has just been through its third hurricane inside a year.

Fay, Gonzalo and Joaquin.  These three storms have all had signifcant
differences and all could have provided immense amounts of invaluable
data.

2015 hurricane season
=====================

Prior to Joaquin, the 2015 season had been quiet, although Erika did
cause flooding and deaths in Dominica.

Track uncertainty
-----------------

Uncertainty in track forecasts has been a feature of some of this
year's storms, with Joaquin being particularly difficult to forecast.

Visitors and weather
====================

Short term forecasts are getting more reliable.

Back in the day, Bermuda used to provide a weather guarantee for
visitors, offering a 10% discount if certain targets were not met.

With modern weather forecasting we are sometimes able to have good
confidence up to 5 days out, with some skill as much as 10-12 days
out.

Bermuda weather is such that visitors are always in danger of heavy
rain during their visits.

Hotels could tailor their offerings to visitors booking at last minute
according to the weather forecast.

Such offers might be effective in boosting visitor numbers during
winter months, especially if combined with forecasts for the Eastern
US and Canada: if we know they are getting freezing conditions, snow
and ice whilst we will have excellent golfing weather it should be an
easy sell.

Gateways
--------

If we can work with those in gateway cities and beyond then we can get
better information on their weather too.

Many Bermudian residents travel widely, good forecasts for the places
they visit would be useful.

Weather informed house swap.

Airlines: weather informed scheuling.

Sustainable transport: geese and swans.

Renewable heaven.

Geek tourism
------------

Free culture is starting to flourish here in Bermuda, it can be a
place that people will want to visit to spend time with those working
on projects here.

Weather and climate research is a global problem.  Bermuda has its own
identity but is culturally diverse, there are good connections with
many parts of the world.
