## cats and catastrophes

Explain we are not talking about cats, but there will be cat pictures.

Catastrophe and catastrophe theory.

## a personal history

Will talk about the computers and languages being used.

And naming conventions.

## A brief history of cat modelling

A personal journey modelling natural catastrophes following
developments in the python community.

Using python in this environment was only possible due to some magical
tools created within the community.

### Reinsurance and natural catastrophes

A quick introduction to the subject.

### Event driven development

The insurance industry is full of inertia.  The main driver of change
are the large events that impact the industry:

* hurricanes
* floods
* earthquakes
* terror

Whenever there is an event, such as an earthquake, hurrricane or
terror the industry gains new perspective.

Events have driven new developments in models and technology.


### The year of the four hurricanes.

2004: Charley, Frances, Jeanne and Ivan.

Four hurricanes in one year hitting Florida.

#### Plotting for fun and profit

Matplotlib and the tale of the stacked bar chart.

Data, data everywhere.

Numpy, pytables, pandas, Scipy, scikit-learn.

### Earthquakes in Christchurch

Three earthquakes in quick succession in the same place.

### Black box models

No separation of hazard, vulnerability and financial models.

### The present

Python helped detect gravitational waves from a billion years away
but is it ready for the enterprise?

#### Cyber

Cybernetics:

>   the science of communications and automatic control systems in both
>   machines and living things.

So cyber is not so much about technology as feedback loops and
control. 

Cyber risk is receiving a lot of attention in the insurance industry.

Infomation insecurity is resulting in leakage of information, often
with significant financial impact to the organisations affected.

Cyber has the potential to be a systematic driver of losses across
many lines of business.

It is a changing peril, with some similaritie to terror: it is
precisely the attacks we have not considered that succeed.

#### Oasis

Open loss model framework: http://www.oasislmf.org/

Separation of hazard, vulnerability and financial models.

Support for niche models, allowing new science to be integrated with
models in a more timely manner.

Uses outside of the insurance industry.  Strategic planning and
emergency management.  Understanding implications of climate change.

### The future

Climate change.

Data analysis challenges.

* finding the data
* new tools, full time job keeping up

Expert teams:

> a team working well together can be many times more effective than
> any individual in that team.  

The world is full of specialists with incredible skills and
knowledge.  When specialists from different disciplines come together
the creative sparks fly.
