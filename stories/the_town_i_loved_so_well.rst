===========================
 The Town I Loved So Well
===========================

After Phil Coulter

In my memory I will always see
the town that I have loved so well
Where our school played ball by the belco(gasyard) wall
and we laughed through the smoke and the smell
Going home in the rain, running up the dark lane
past the park and down behind the birdcage,
Those were happy days in so many, many ways
in the town I loved so well

In the early morning the Johnny Barnes love,
called women from St Georges, Somerset and Pembroke,
While the men on the wall played a mother's role,
fed the children and then trained the dogs
And when times got tough there was just about enough
But they saw it through without complaining
For deep inside was a burning pride
in the town I loved so well

There was music there in the Bemie air
like a language that we all could understand
I remember the day when I earned my first pay
And I played in a small pick-up band
There I spent my youth and to tell you the truth
I was sad to leave it all behind me
For I learned about life and I'd found a wife
in the town I loved so well

But when I returned how my eyes have burned
to see how a town could be brought to its knees
By the evil of greed and the schools dismay
and the frog that hangs on to every tree
Now the debt is installed by that old Belco wall
and the damned cutback gets higher and higher
With their banks and their loans, oh my God, what have they done
to the town I loved so well

Now the music's gone but they carry on
For their spirit's been bruised, never broken
They will not forget but their hearts are set
on tomorrow and peace once again
For what's done is done and what's won is won
and what's lost is lost and gone forever
I can only pray for a bright, brand new day
in the town I loved so well
