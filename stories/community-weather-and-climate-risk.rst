==================================
Community Weather and Climate Risk
==================================

I have submitted a talk proposal to PyCon Caribbean.

They have their own web based submission system, but I would like to
develop the ideas for the talk here.

Pull requests would be great to have.

Description
===========

Community weather and climate:

   Combining local expertise with global collaboration to understand
   and mitigate the impacts of our changing climate. Particular
   reference to Atlantic hurricanes and their impact on the
   Caribbean. How we can work together to provide life saving
   information and understanding.

Abstract
========   
   
** I'm late! **

So this proposal is late. It is partly a software project, and every
one of those has been late.

I'm working to develop python and free software community here in
Bermuda. The potential is huge, and it can have a really positive
impact here and beyond. But things take time.

There is a lot of expertise in hurricanes. We have had three here in
just over a year.

Every season brings new insights. The models are getting good, but
still need careful interpretation.

One notable feature this year was that there was significant
uncertainty in the paths that storms would take, but the models were
able to give good insight on the impact given a particular track.

Compute resources are cheap these days, even the power to run them can
be provided by solar, wind or wave.

By sharing data and simulating multiple models across locations we can
provide more information to help mitigate the impact of storms.

Further, we can provide risk analyses for the likely impact of current
and future human behaviour on our climate.

Outline
=======

This is a work in progress.  I will be looking for imagery to
illustrate each point.   Let's 30 images, 1 minute a piece.

Which reminds me, I need to work on the (random) pechakucha project.

There is an example of what the proposal committee are looking for as
