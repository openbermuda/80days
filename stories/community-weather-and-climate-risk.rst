==================================
Community Weather and Climate Risk
==================================

I have submitted a talk proposal to PyCon Caribbean.

They have their own web based submission system, but I would like to
develop the ideas for the talk here.

Pull requests would be great to have.

Description
===========

Community weather and climate:

   Combining local expertise with global collaboration to understand
   and mitigate the impacts of our changing climate. Particular
   reference to Atlantic hurricanes and their impact on the
   Caribbean. How we can work together to provide life saving
   information and understanding.

Abstract
========   
   
I'm working to develop python and free software community here in
Bermuda. The potential is huge, and it can have a really positive
impact here and beyond. But things take time.

There is a lot of expertise in hurricanes. We have had three here in
just over a year.

Every season brings new insights. The models are getting good, but
still need careful interpretation.

One notable feature this year was that there was significant
uncertainty in the paths that storms would take, but the models were
able to give good insight on the impact given a particular track.

Compute resources are cheap these days, even the power to run them can
be provided by solar, wind or wave.

By sharing data and simulating multiple models across locations we can
provide more information to help mitigate the impact of storms.

Further, we can provide risk analyses for the likely impact of current
and future human behaviour on our climate.

Outline
=======

This is a work in progress.  I will be looking for imagery to
illustrate each point.   Let's 30 images, 1 minute a piece.

Which reminds me, I need to work on the (random) pechakucha project.

There is an example of what the proposal committee are looking for as

Introduction
------------

I have worked with risk managements systems over the last 18 years.
Through this time I have been working with open source software, using
great tools to build systems to assess risk.

Hurricanes have always been an interest.  Much of this time I have
been living in Bermuda, where I now live.  I have a keen interest in
weather and climate.

Climate change presents challenges to risk modelling and weather
forecasting.

There have been significant developments in computing, especially the
low cost and low power raspberry pi.

Software developments too.  Making things.

Data, data, everywhere.

I will begin with some observations from the last two Atlantic
hurricane seasons.

Hurricanes
----------

2014 and 2015 seasons
+++++++++++++++++++++

Erika and Fay

Is there anyone attending that could talk about Erika?

Gonzalo and Joaquin
```````````````````

Are there others that have information about Joaquin?  Also the
flooding caused be systems active at the same time.

Damage surveys

Precipitation

Climate Change

* current climate is at the edge of our historical record of data.

Ice Cap melting

Ocean

Rising sea levels

Extreme weather events

Growing evidence that frequency of extreme events is increasing.

Data to support this?

Changes in Precipitation

Raspberry Pi

Personal weather stations
-------------------------

Raspberry pi's provide a cheap way to create simple weather
stations. A simple station that measures air pressure, temperature and
humidity can be built for less than $50.

The power requirements are low, so stations can be powered by solar
trickle charging a small battery.

Anemometers and wind direction sensors are valuable additions to
have and can be built at reasonably low cost.


Learning
++++++++

Building these stations is an excellent project for a school or
college.

Once built, these provide lots of opportunities for school projects
related to weather.

In particular, studying the data from the stations can provide
interesting insights.

For example, when I built a station myself, I learnt that the
atmosphere is tidal.

Data
----

Data, data, everywhere.

There are a growing group of weather enthusiasts that have their own
personal weather stations.

Weather Underground
+++++++++++++++++++

Sunshine
++++++++


Open Data
+++++++++

Satellite Imagery
+++++++++++++++++

Radar
+++++

One of the most used resources in Bermuda are the animated radar
images that the weather service provides.

This data could also be used to estimate rainfall.  With rainfall
readings from lots of weather stations it should be possible to
calibrate models and gain better insight into rainfall within storms.
